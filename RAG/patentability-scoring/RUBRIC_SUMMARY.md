# AI/Software Provisional Patent Rubric
## 95th Percentile Quality Assessment

**Total Points: 100** | **Top 5% Threshold: 90+** | **Passing: 75+**

## Quick Reference: What Makes a Top-Tier Provisional Patent?

A **"Transaction-Ready"** provisional patent application overcomes THREE future arguments:

| Audience | Their Argument | How You Overcome It |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Licensees/Investors | "Why should we pay you?" | Clear prior art differentiation |
| Patent Examiner | "This is obvious" | Detailed technical disclosure |
| Copycats/Infringers | "We can design around this" | Workarounds already covered |

## Scoring Categories (100 Points Total)

### 1. Technical Disclosure Quality (30 pts)

| Criterion | Points | Key Question |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| HOW not WHAT | 8 | Does it explain how the system works, not just what it does? |
| Hardware Context | 6 | Is software described with CPU, memory, storage, network? |
| Algorithm Details | 8 | Are method steps, data flows, processing logic clear? |
| Enablement | 8 | Could a developer implement this without asking questions? |

**The Test:** Could you outsource development using ONLY this document?

### 2. Drawings & Figures (20 pts)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| System Diagram | 5 | Network/architecture showing all components |
| Hardware Block | 4 | Processor, memory, I/O relationships |
| Method Flowcharts | 6 | Software process flows with decision points |
| Interface Mockups | 3 | UI examples if applicable |
| Data Flow/Swimlane | 2 | Data movement between entities |

**Remember:** Sketches are fine! Multiple rough drawings > one perfect CAD drawing.

### 3. Novelty & Differentiation (15 pts)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Prior Art Awareness | 5 | Evidence of Google, patent, academic search |
| Point of Difference | 5 | Clear articulation of what's new |
| Problem-Solution | 5 | Technical problem and how you solve it |

### 4. Scope & Protection (15 pts)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Workarounds & Variations | 8 | Alternative implementations described |
| Future Variations | 4 | 2nd/3rd generation improvements |
| Broad-to-Narrow | 3 | General concepts → specific examples |

**Key Principle:** "Steal from yourself before competitors do"

Example: "The closure may be velcro, a snap, a zipper, or **any mechanical coupling/uncoupling device**"

### 5. Implementation Details (10 pts)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Manufacturing/Deployment | 5 | How it can be built/deployed |
| Materials/Tech Stack | 3 | Languages, databases, infrastructure |
| Real-World Walkthrough | 2 | Actual use case described |

### 6. AI-Specific Requirements (10 pts)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Practical Application | 4 | Not mere data processing, tangible improvement |
| Not Abstract | 3 | Avoids abstract idea characterization |
| Inventorship Docs | 3 | Human contribution documented (2025 requirement) |

## RED FLAGS (Automatic Deductions)

| Red Flag | Deduction |
|----------|-----------|
| Marketing language instead of technical | -10 |
| Only describes WHAT, not HOW | -15 |
| No drawings or figures | -10 |
| Vague "uses AI/ML" without specifics | -8 |
| No hardware context for software | -10 |

---

## BONUS POINTS (Up to +10)

| Bonus | Points |
|-------|--------|
| Informal claims included | +3 |
| Multiple embodiments detailed | +3 |
| Competitive workaround analysis | +2 |
| Continuation strategy considered | +2 |

---

## Grading Scale

| Score | Grade | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 95-100 | **Transaction Ready** | Ready for licensing/investment |
| 85-94 | Excellent | Minor gaps to address |
| 75-84 | Good (Passing) | Solid foundation |
| 65-74 | Needs Work | Significant gaps |
| 50-64 | Insufficient | Unlikely to support strong claims |
| <50 | Worthless | Marketing fluff, no protection |

## Key Insights from Expert Sources

### Steve Key (inventRight)
> "A transaction-ready provisional patent application is a selling tool that overcomes potential arguments."

### Patent Attorney (Software Specialist)
> "Focus 95% of effort on detailed description. Write in plain engineer language, not like a patent attorney."

### Dylan Adams (Patent Strategist)
> "The provisional is a placeholder. You only get credit for what you actually disclose."
