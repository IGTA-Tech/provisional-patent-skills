        "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about how to protect your invention I'm going to show you some great things to do to write that provisional patent application that truly has value so stay tuned [Music] all right everybody some people don't even know what a provisional patent application is so let's start at the very beginning and this here the slide I'm showing you here basically tells you what it is and I found that on Wikipedia but in my language my terms I'm going to tell you when you have an invention this is the first thing you should do to put that stake in the ground to give you that first date that hey I've got something new I've got something novel and I'm going to start to protect it it's a great tool it's called a provisional patent application we also call it a PPA okay so what is the provisional patent application right you guys in simple terms you have an idea it's new and novel and you want to start to protect it you're going to file a provisional patent application it's called a PPA it gives you that first date that you came up with an idea because you want to claim to the world you're the true inventor okay so what are the benefits of a provisional patent application well first of all it lets you test the market to see if anybody even cares it also gives you the time to investigate it's a very low cost tool but the great thing about it is when you file the first one you don't have all the answers there's a very good chance you're going to discover new things and you're going to have to file another one so this allows you to file the first one and you can file multiple ppas during that year because it's a year long and you can bring them all together and combine them right at the end of the year of the first date of that first filing wow it's a great testing tool if you went ahead and filed a non-provisional patent application that gets expensive that could be in the tens of thousands of dollars and if you had new information you would have to file another one so a provisional patent application is a great tool to test ideas it gives you patent pending status for one year and it's extremely affordable so during this video I'm going to show you how to write a provisional patent application that really has value and no one's going to show you how to do this no patent attorney is going to show you how to do this you need to learn to do this yourself the reason why no one's going to help you do this is going to take too much time and energy and money and you cannot afford for them to do the work you need to do so let me show you how to create a provisional patent application that I call transaction ready that is going to have value not only to an investor to a potential licensee to anybody it's actually going to protect your invention but also the Innovation and you can use it as a selling tool so what is a transaction ready provisional patent application it's a document that shows that you know what you're talking about it's a document that when someone sees it it establishes trust because you're taking away fear you're taking away risk that's why it's so important to do this correctly all right this is the part I love the most if you write a provisional patent application the correct way it's going to overcome future arguments this is the part that's really important you have to understand if you write your provisional patent application correctly in which I term transaction ready is going to overcome three future arguments the first argument when you show your invention to a to a potential licensee a company that's looking for ideas or you show it to a potential investor they're going to look at it the first thing they're going to say is why are we paying you because maybe there's some similar ideas out there maybe there's some prior patents out there if you write it this way and they look at it they're going to see this and go wow you did a good job we understand we should pay you so that's the first argument that's why you have to do this correctly the second argument if you file this correctly that it's a transaction provisional patent application a year later when you file the non-provisional patent application the real patent which costs a lot of money you're going to be submitting that to the USPTO and a pad examiner is going to get it his job is to find the priorit his job is to look at it and find things out there to reject your claims and if you follow this the right way you have a better chance of getting your patent issued so that's that second argument you're going to overcome that patent examiner why he's going to reject your patent application let me show you how to overcome that argument all right okay here we go the third argument infringement copycats you know those guys they're trying to steal your idea if you follow that advice I've given you now there's a very good chance you're going to make it a very very compelling argument of why they should not copy your idea all right so the big benefit when you write it this way it's a selling tool but it overcomes potential arguments so what's really great about this you guys I like to look at provisional patent applications as a selling tool yes you want to protect your invention and I'm going to show you how to protect the Innovation but I'm going to show you how to write it so it actually sells your invention it's a selling tool I'm going to show you how so how do you write a transaction ready provisional patent application you need to be a detective you need to gather information together you need to be curious but you need to write this in such a way that anybody could read it and understand it it needs to be clear it needs to be just so easy for people to put themselves in this situation to really understand the problem and that's the first thing the problem describe it in such a way that anybody can understand the problem you're talking about you want them to to feel like they're there they observe it they see it so that's the first thing you need to do now the second your Solution that's your invention okay you need to also describe your point of difference and we'll talk more about that in a minute in such a way that your solution to this problem your invention is very clearly stated right don't make it complicated make it very easy for anybody to understand all right the next Manufacturing in materials most applications do not include this information and I think that's a big mistake most patents are not worth anything because they don't include this information now how do you get manufacturing and material information because most of us don't know how to do it well you need to watch how your product could potentially be made because if they can't make it no one's going to pay you anything so how do you do that well you can watch YouTube uh channels on information of how your things are being made you could visit a manufacturing facility you can even hire an ex-employee of some of these companies and and understand how your idea could be implemented and you could hire these people ex-employees you can find them on LinkedIn it's not hard to do have them sign an NDA with work for hire language so whatever they tell you you own but if you can't include this type of information in your provisional patent application it truly has value and no one does that you need to do that okay next there's the big one here's the big one you need to include workarounds and variations workarounds and variations what does that mean that means you need to steal it from yourself right you need to come up with how how many different ways could they someone could come up with my idea it's pretty simple when you think about it if you steal it from yourself not only are you protecting your invention but you're really trying to protect the Innovation and when you do it this way you're blocking others just do to not file or you know something that's a little different than yours you're trying to get broad protection and and it's very important to do that okay next thing and I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a minute too tell a story and you do that with drawings a drawing is worth a thousand words and if you if you do a lot of drawings good line drawings they don't have to be patent drawings but good line drawings that really tell the story it makes it makes it easier for people to understand your provisional patent application guess what you've just wrote it in such a way with all this information it's transaction ready someone could take it and they can implement it you've answered all their questions you've taken away all their concerns you've reduced some risk and you've told a great story that's what you need to do okay let's talk about that first thing I talked about knowing your point of difference and how do you do that you're going to do that doing a Google image search a Google shopping search and you can do that looking for prior prior patents prior art what you're really trying to do is is look at the roadblocks the the road bumps out ahead because your product will hit those roadblocks if you don't know what's out ahead and if you know it's out of heavy if you really know your point of difference compared to everything else out there you're going to overcome those arguments specially with investors potential licensees but really with that patent examiner so you must know your point of difference manufacturing you look at the slide here James is going to show you this is a product that I'm involved in called fishbone the equipment to put on this piece of cardboard with basically six holes runs at very high speeds in fact it's it's built with robotics now what do I know about manufacturing things like this not much but I know how to get the information I know how to find the right companies that can help me get that information and put that in my provisional patent application right so now it truly has value how do you make it so to find out how to manufacture it a couple things you can do go on the internet that go to the manufacturing facility find the experts also know all the materials too all right I'm going to show you in fact I need to give you kind of an idea about how to expand certain words that talk about maybe work around the variations here's a quick example if I have a new let's say a bag I have a new bag to put things in and this bag has a velcro closure I could open it and close it because it has velcro well if I'm going to expand the way I'm thinking about this if I want to put in workarounds and variations I might say look it could be velcro it could be a snap it could be a hook it could be a zipper in fact it could be any closing medical it could be any mechanical closing device wow it just went from narrow too broad but guess what what if I said anyway to couple and uncouple those two sides for me to get in it and close it up I just included everything you could possibly think about those are the type of words that when you include in your provisional patent application protects not only your invention but the Innovation technical drawings hey look you could also send a photograph you could even you know scribble notes and finally file it at the provisional patent application but just because you could shoot you know you shouldn't use nice line drawings call out exactly what you want people to understand make it so easy for people to see exactly what you're trying to do for them to exactly can see what your invention is I also include a couple workarounds and variations because when I do that I understand that a picture is worth a thousand words and it's really important to show your Brilliance show your invention so include a lot of drawings okay you guys real quick right I'm going to recap it again transaction ready provisional patent notification how do you do it first of all know the problem make it so simple anybody can understand the solution that's your invention make sure everybody's clear and you know your point of difference but material manufacturing really really important of course the workarounds the variations you got to steal it from yourself and the drawings a drawings worth a thousand words when you put this all together now you can tell a story that's all it really is it's telling a very compelling story that's going to overcome arguments make it very clear very simple for people to understand and now it's a great selling tool so when you create a provisional patent application that's transaction ready you've done something most people will never do in fact what you've done you've created a tool to sell to license your invention so what are the benefits I want to talk about once again it's going to help you get potential licensees interested it's going to overcome arguments it's going to get people that want to license it from you it's going to help protect it it's going to provide confidence for some of the work with you but you know what it also does it allows you if you want to start a company to bring a team together because you know what you're talking about all right I'm going to go through some of the benefits you guys when you do it this way when you start when you create a transaction ready provisional patent application it takes away risks it provides a clear roadmap app answers all the questions overcomes the arc the obstacles it covers all aspects of your intellectual property it gives people confidence to move forward with you increases your chances to obtain an issued patent stops potentially infringement and not only protects your invention but now it protects your Innovation all right now I went through a lot of information here and I know for a lot of you it's going to be holy cow Steve this is really overwhelming if you need help make sure to reach out to me you can reach out to me reach out to invent right we can help you also we have a great program called smart IP that when you combine this great information with the software that helps you write it it's going to be fantastic and it's extremely affordable okay subscribe down below if you like this video I will see you next time [Music] thank you"

        "transcript": "As a patent attorney with over 20 years of experience, I've seen a lot of clients who are intimidated and confused about how to draft a provisional patent application. So, in this video, I'm going to give you the insider techniques of how to draft a provisional application related to software or computer inventions and how to make it easy so you can maximize the benefit and protection that you get from the provisional application. So, what do I mean by computer inventions or software related inventions? For example, this could be a web page or a phone app that receives data, sends it to a server, gets a response, and presents an output to a user. It could be something also like a standalone product such as a robotic system or an appliance that operates primarily locally via software or firmware. So, obviously, some of these systems have physical components. So, check out my video as well related to drafting provisional patent applications on physical inventions. So, let's start off with some basics about provisional patent applications to make sure that we're all on the same page. So, there's two ways to start the patent process. One is with a non-provisional patent application, and this is the full formal application that should be attorney drafted, has all the formal requirements, tends to be pretty expensive, and this is the application you file at the USPTO, and it waits in line for 1 to 3 years before examination begins. And then it starts a negotiation with the examiner where you're trying to convince the examiner that what you have is new and non-obvious over the prior art and you're trying to get the broadest claims possible. So this back and forth can go on for a long time. It could be months, sometimes years, and hopefully your application is allowed eventually and then we'll issue as a patent. So the other way to start the process, and what we're going to be talking about today, is with a provisional patent application. Provisional patent applications are just a placeholder. They only last for one year. They automatically expire at the end of the year and that term cannot be extended. Now, one of the most important things to understand about provisional patent applications is that you only get credit for what you actually disclose in the application. The USPTO is literally going to accept pretty much anything that you file and will slap patent pending on that and will give you a filing date. But it's completely possible that you could file a provisional patent application and it's going to be totally worthless. I've seen this a lot of times where people just have a one paragraph abstract, this tiny little disclosure, and yes, they can get a filing date on it and technically they're patent pending, but that is absolutely worthless and gives them no protection. Now, even if you do a good job and have a lot of description, especially with computer and software related inventions, it's especially tricky. I've seen people with very detailed descriptions of the of the how the software works or how the hardware works or how the overall network or system works, but at the same time, they don't have the right details. And yeah, while they have a lot of content, it's the wrong content and so it doesn't really give them all that much protection and it makes the provisional kind of worthless. Now, when learning how to draft a provisional patent application, it's pretty much as important to understand what not to focus on as to what to actually focus on. And this is a big issue I see with a lot of folks is, like I said, they draft these huge descriptions, but it has the the wrong details and they focus on the wrong things and they spend all their energy on stuff that is effectively worthless. So, the first thing I notice a lot of times is people trying to write like a patent attorney. That's a huge mistake and it's a lot of effort in trying to have a certain style when that style doesn't really help with patentability. Yes, it's fun to try to draft like a like like a patent and use that language, but you're not going to get a lot of benefit. You should save your energy and your effort for things that are actually going to give you some protective benefit. Some other things that I see a lot of times that people are spending their time on are things like the title, the field of the invention, the background, or the claim section. So with the title, do not agonize over the title. I've talked to some people where they say, \"Oh, you know, I've I've gone back and forth on the title and we we spent all this time workshopping it.\" Like, do not spend that time that it's wasted time. I I'll tell you later on the things that you want to focus on. Similar, you'll see in non-provisional patent applications, they have the field of invention. Again, this is not required for provisional patent applications. Don't spend any time on it. It's not required. Um, and especially if you're going to be agonizing over something like this, save your effort for something else. Another thing, and this is especially a counterintuitive one, is the background section. I see a lot of people who sometimes they'll spend more time on the background section than the actual detailed description. And really, the background section doesn't really give you a lot of benefit. The main target audience for the background section is going to be people like investors and people who don't know about patents who are reading the patent application. Especially in a provisional, which is not substantly examined at all, it doesn't really matter having a background. And if anything, backgrounds can actually be used against you. So, anything that you have in the background is admitted prior art. And so, a lot of times, I'll leave a background section out or keep it very, very basic. And later on, I'm going to give you some uh suggestions on how to do the background section, right? The next one is claims. Now, claims for one, they are not required in a provisional patent application. And this is another place where I see people trying to write like a patent attorney. have a good time drafting these claims, but they're effectively worthless. There's no benefit to having claims in a provisional patent application, aside from one little asterk that I'll discuss later on, but it's not something you should spend a lot of time on. I see a lot of folks who spend all this time trying to craft these claims and and trying to write like a patent attorney. And usually that's going to be worthless and they spend more time on this than drafting the detailed description, which is the most important thing. Another thing is perfect drawings. And while having good drawings is important, they don't need to be absolutely perfect. So a mistake that people make is they spend all this time learning how to do something on CAD and they have to have these perfect drawings, submit hours and hours and hours when they could have done things really quickly just sketching things out by hand or sketching things out on a on the computer in a basic kind of way. Drawings don't need to be absolutely perfect. And one thing I tell people a lot of times is I would rather have a bunch of sketches that are really crappy and janky than one super perfect really nice drawing. So don't spend too much time on these things. Focus on what's really important which is the detailed description. So then what are the things you should actually be focusing on if you want to draft a provisional application and make it easy while also getting the most protection and getting the best filing date possible. So the first thing is instead of trying to write like a patent attorney and learn how to do that, write in the plain language of an engineer or a developer and write in language that you would understand or someone like that would understand. Now the true standard is it just needs to be such that one of ordinary skill in the art that being your average person who works in the field can make and use the invention based on your description. So that you know that that that's the mistake a lot of people make is they try to draft like a patent and you use all this flowery language but they should really write in their own voice especially for people who know about software who know about computer systems. Write in language that you understand. That should be the target voice. that is so much easier than trying to write in this new contrived kind of way. Write in your own language and it's going to be so much easier for you. So a good example as far as like what information you want to provide and on what level think if you had to outsource development of your product and you had to give a guide to somebody that if they were an engineer right or a software developer someone like that if they could make the invention and use it based off of that description without having to give you any without having to ask you for any more information. What would that guide be? What were the what would the basic things that a software engineer would need to have to be able to make and use your invention? Now, another critical thing especially for software and computer related inventions is focusing on how the system works and not just what it is. This is the biggest mistake I see folks make when they're drafting their own provisional applications related to software and computer technology. They say, \"Hey, this thing is so much better and has this functionality. Does this and it happens faster and here's the hardware it's running on. It's it's so much better and has these functionalities.\" But that's kind of worthless. It's not about what the system does. It's about how it does that. And I'll talk a bit later about how to actually get protective value and how to cover the how instead of just the what. So then for computer and software inventions what's going to be most important is going to be the method that is performed to create the functionalities of the software product or the system. So for instance you have an interface and input is received and then what happens then like where is that input sent where is that data sent to say it goes to a server what processing goes on at the server side how is that data processed does it go to other systems or is it just directly sent back to the to the the user device and then what happens at the user device how is that presented at at at the user device. It's going to be those methods that are going to be most important to patentability. Now, when it comes to drafting the provisional application, a lot of times it can be easy to start with the figures as a base. So, when it comes to drafting figures or drawings for your patent application, you want to be telling a story of how the invention works. And I like to start at the very beginning, the the basics. So, one is sort of a network diagram. So, for instance, you have your your system. Is it something that is connected to the internet? How is it connected? Is it via network? Does it talk to a server? Are there a group of servers? What devices are involved in this system? A lot of times it's not just going to be the user device is going to be a back-end server. There could be other components. Um, talk about sort of the basics of the device. Sometimes this is a really simple thing. It's just going to be a device and a server connected via network. Other times it can be more complex and sort of have a general diagram of that. Next is if you have something that has an interface, have an example of what that interface is. Maybe you haven't built it. that's totally fine. But just sketch out a basic understanding of what the interface is so that you can tell that story of how do users interact with this? What are the buttons? Things like that. What sort of uh in information is being input. Another thing I like to have is swim or data flow diagrams. And I'll show some examples of those here. Those can be helpful in understanding how data is obtained, what sort of data is obtained, where does it go, how is it processed down the road, say on the server side, what goes on there, and then what data is sent back to the user device. Those can be really helpful in understanding the flow of data in the system. Also, method diagrams um and this is uh how data is processed. So you a lot of times you'll have these method steps and I'll provide you some examples here of what uh method diagrams look like but really you know it can be really simple it can be complex just make sure that if you start getting this really really huge diagram with a lot of method steps try to break it up into multiple multiple figures if it's too complex now these are just some examples of things that I find to be useful in drafting invention disclosures or provisional patent patent applications or non-provisional patent applications related to computer software and computer hardware technology. But if these things are difficult, if you've never seen these before, if you're not comfortable with this, don't feel like you need to learn how to draft these sort of figures or these diagrams. You don't want to be doing something and learning something from scratch. If these don't make sense to you, write things in a way or draw things in a way or create figures in a way that makes sense to you. There's no right way, there's no wrong way to do these things. If you don't have some of these diagrams in there, hey, it's not that big of a deal. You know, you just need to get the information out in a way that is understandable to software developers or engineers, people who work in the field. That's what's most important. It's not a specific form that it needs to be in. And these are just some examples. So, don't feel like you have to use any of these. Once you have the figures, then you're going to want to start drafting the detailed description. Now, in certain patent applications, you'll see all sorts of other things like the background, the field of invention, a summary, but what's really important is having a detailed description. Don't worry too much about having these special sections and having these things that are required. Like, that doesn't really matter that much. What really matters is the detailed description. That's where you should be focusing most of your time. So, this should really be a walkthrough of the drawing. So, start with each drawing and go into great detail about the drawing, what it shows, what the pieces are, how they're interconnected. go into great detail about each each drawing. Be sure to write in narrative form. So, don't have bullets or just don't have it be an outline. Have it be in narrative form and have a lot of detail. It's not just sort of a a summary of things, you know, just with bullet points. It should be a full description about things. So, of course, you're going to be talking about the main embodiment that you have, that being sort of the main commercial product that you have envisioned or that you're you're actually going to be coming out with, but you want to describe all sorts of variations as well. And that's how you have a really broad patent application that's going to be able to cover a lot of variations in addition to what you're looking to do. Because really, you want to cover what you're doing, but also what competitors are going to do. You want to have it so that if competitors come in the market, they can't easily design around your patent application and make little tweaks and changes to it and then suddenly they're doing something that's totally different. You want all the variations to be covered so that if competitors come out and do it, they're still going to be infringing. But similarly, and this happens a lot in product development, especially with startups, as you get it in front of customers and investors, and as as you do more R&D, your product is going to change. So, you're going to want to talk about things that you may do in the future. Think about things that are going to be better. So if price was no object, for instance, you know, if you could spend as much money as you wanted on manufacturing or or things like that, what are the things that you would do that maybe going to be the second or third generation once you've built the company more? Talk about those things now because then you're going to be able to protect them now. You can protect them well before you're doing it. You can protect them well before your competitors are doing them. Also in you you want to be thinking about things that are better and things that are that are really good, but also think about things that are second and third best. So a good example here is that let's say we have a competitor who comes out and they come out with this crappy version of what you're doing, not something that you would ever want to have. You will still want that to be protected. And so talk about ways that maybe it'll be, you know, it'll be slower or cheaper or it's, you know, for whatever reason it's not going to be as good. talk about those examples as well because if a competitor comes out and they have some crappy version that's not as good, you still want that to be covered as well so you can stop them even though it's not as good of a product. And people always say, well, but you know, I don't necessarily know what we're going to do. We don't have the specifics. Make stuff up. That's totally fine. You can come up with a lot of different examples. Brainstorm. Have a good time with it. Make things up. You can throw in as much as you want. And if you happen to then actually implement some of these things, you'll want to have that description in there. If your competitors come out and they happen to have those things in there, you're going to want to have that description in there. So, throw in the kitchen sink, come up with a lot of different variations. You are not limited to just what you're able to do now or what you know that you can do now. You can put in all sorts of fun variations. Another thing that can be really useful when drafting your provisional application is doing a walkth through of how the product is actually used in the real world. So how would somebody actually interact with it? How would they use it? And if it's a computer product, so for instance, how would you know what what goes on at the server side? So you know user is using it then data is sent to the server. what goes on there and what's what is the specific data that is being processed and then what is the output in a very specific sort of use case and with products too you know like well what are people actually going to be doing with this thing who is going to be using it is it going to be a scientist or a consumer or is it going to be uh an engineer like who are the people who are going to actually be using this and in what context tell a story that can be really helpful and these things aren't going to be limiting if you do them Right. Now, drafting the figures and the detailed description should be 95% of the effort that you're putting into the provisional patent application. So, then what is going to be that extra 5% of drafting that you're going to be doing? One is that if you have time, write a short summary of the invention sort of based on your full description and put that at the beginning of the detailed description. It can kind of be good to have a a summary up front without referring to the drawings just to kind of give somebody a little like kind of like an abstract, but put that in the detailed description as well. Also, if you have time, you can write a background section. People love to write background section because it kind of sets up the problem, but one of the important things with that is you you you're not required to have a background. It's not an essential thing that most people are going to be looking at, but a lot of times if you're going to be showing the provisional application to investors and things like that, that can really be good optics for them. IC and sort of set up the problem and what the current state of the art is. But the critical thing with the background is do not talk about your invention in the background. Anything in the background is admitted to be prior to art and can be used against you. That's why a lot of times we just skip the background section or make it really really short or high level. Don't go anything above one to two paragraphs. It's it's kind of a waste of time. Another thing is the title. And like I said, I I hear people who say, \"Well, we we like workshop the title and we're going back and forth.\" No, don't do it. you know, just just have a really quick title. I mean, really, most of the time, what we're going to do is going to be whatever it is and then just tack systems and methods onto the end. Don't put more than a a few minutes into the title. It really does not matter. It's not going to be something that's going to make any sort of difference whatsoever. And the final thing that you should not be spending much time on is the claim section. So, I did say that claims are not required in a provisional patent application, but for for purposes of foreign protection, you need to have at least one dummy claim in there. And it's really simple. I'll give you the language now. It's just the systems and methods shown and described herein. That should be it for the claims. There is a page at the end. It says claims. There is the number one. And then it just says the systems and methods described here. And that should be it. Do not spend a lot of time trying to formulate claims and draft them like a patent attorney or sound like a patent. That is a huge waste of your time and effort. Um, and the biggest mistake I see people make is with the claims is they end up putting in so much more detail in the claims that really should have been in the detailed description. Things that like aren't in the detailed description, but are just in the claims. And if they're just in the claims, they're really not supported. The support comes from the detailed description. Now claims like I said are not required in provisional applications. They nothing happens claims the the provisional application is just a placeholder. It is not examined in any substant way. It is only at the non-provisional stage that then you will have claims and then you will have to have the examination process related to those claims. So please do not waste your time on claims. It's one of those things that you know is just it's a total waste of time. You should be focusing on that detailed description because that's where protection really is. So with the full structure of the provisional application in mind, here are some additional important details that you need to be mindful of. One is the drawings must be in full black and white. And this means they cannot have grayscale. And of course, they cannot have color. It needs to be 100% black and white. So when you're drafting the drawings, pull out any sort of grayscale, pull out any sort of color. make make sure that it's going to be full true black and white because when you file the drawings of the USPTO it's going to be converted to black and white and the problem I see a lot of times is people have color or other things that is that makes it so that that's there there's understanding there and important details can be obscured and lost upon conversion at the USPTO. So make sure you have true black and white drawings that you're going to be submitting. Another thing like I said is the drawings don't have to be absolutely perfect. You can do handline drawings and as long as it's black and white, that's totally fine. I always say I would rather have a ton of drawings and figures that are crappy and handdrawn than one perfect CAD drawing that you spend hours and hours and hours on. So, the drawings can be incorporated into the description. That's totally fine. Having the drawings in line if you feel like that's helpful. But if whether or not you do that, definitely have each drawing on a separate sheet of its own in as large size as possible. The reason here is because again, you only get credit for what is actually filed. And sometimes people file the drawings and they're kind of small tiny form and the the the small details or the small text gets lost upon filing and you don't get credit for that. So even if you have stuff in line in the text document, create specific sheets with each of the drawing figures and have it fill up as much space as possible so the small details and the small text, they aren't lost. And of course, the biggest thing when drafting the provisional application is that content is way more important than form. I would have rather have way more detail and have there even be spelling mistakes and have it just be flow of consciousness than have you know maybe a page or two that is perfectly written like a patent attorney and has flowery language and things like that. It's way better to have almost informal description in narrative form than to have this perfectly craft crafted pros. So detail and more volume of detail that's going to get you more protective value. it's not in just the form of how that is provided. So, being able to draft it like a patent attorney does not help give you more protection in the provisional application. It's best to start the drafting process with just kind of a brain dump. Get all the information down on paper and then go back to refine it. So, one of the things that you don't want to have in there is limiting language. you you want to remove that once you've kind of gotten all the concepts down on paper. Now, the thing about limiting language is that it's if you have this in the provisional application and especially in the non-provisional application, it can be used against you down the road to limit your scope of protection and make it so that people can say, well, you know, you limited yourself to this very specific thing. Our product doesn't infringe because you use this specific language. Okay, so the the basics of removing limited language is don't have anything that describes the whole invention. And strangely enough, the best practice is never to use the term invention ever. Everything is just an example. It's an it's an embodiment. You never want to pin it down to say the invention is this or the invention is critically including these things or it has to do this. have everything be optional because yes that may be important in your embodiment in your commercial embodiment but a competitor may not have that and so if you limit yourself to saying this is essential this has to be in there the invention is this that can be used against you down the road and of course you want to talk about hey in some examples it can be important to do this or that but couch it in being in specific examples or specific embodiment. Now, unfortunately, limiting language is really confusing and counterintuitive and one of those things that even patent attorneys, it takes years and years and years of experience to kind of learn about these things. It's not something that is easy to describe in a lot of ways. And so, that's why a lot of times I suggest doing what I call a coached provisional patent application. And so, for instance, what I'll do is I will coach my clients on drafting invention disclosure then that then I will scrub to remove limiting language. If anything, broaden things here and there. make sure it has the right formatting, make sure it has the right detail, and then file that as a provisional patent application. That tends to be the right balance in terms of cost and and time and ROI, especially for clients that are going to be doing startups and things where it's really important. If if you definitely don't have any money, if you are on a budget or if you're just kind of doing this for fun, maybe you don't necessarily need to run it through a a patent attorney. But if you're if you but if you have a startup and it's important that you get solid protection, a lot of times doing the coach provisional can be really good. Make sure you run it by a patent attorney to make sure that you actually do have the right detail, that it's in the right form, that you don't have limiting language, and you don't have stuff in there that's going to like bite you in the ass down the road that you can't undo. Now, once you've drafted everything and removed liming language, then you want to do sort of the final formatting of things if things aren't already formatted. One is thing to keep in mind is that USPTO is going to accept pretty much anything that you file as a provisional patent application. So, you need to make sure that it's in the right form because the PTO is not going to tell you that you've screwed things up. And it's only going to be years down the road when you're trying to get priority based on this provisional application that it's going to be in litigation or enforcement that people are going to say, \"Oh, well, you actually had this limiting language in there. You know, your drawings, they were too small and you couldn't see these details, so you don't get get this priority.\" So, make sure that you have things right before you file the application. Like I said, it's great insurance to have a patent attorney do this kind of work with the coach provisional. Make sure it's in the right form. This can be especially important if you're going to be attracting investors. Investors are going to have to see this provisional application and they're going to want it to smell right and look right. And if it doesn't, they're going to be more likely to pass on you as a potential investment. Some of the simple things are to make sure that you have the same font throughout. Make sure it's at least 12 point size so that when you file it, the the small text isn't lost. And then have things with paragraph numbers. Number each paragraph. I'll kind of give you an example here. And then put the drawings if you have them in line in the text. Also have this put them in separate sheets so that the small text and you know maybe small figures and uh small little aspects of the drawings aren't lost. You want to have them on separate sheets. Then what you do is just send it to your patent attorney to file it as a provisional application or they'll do this editing for you and they'll be ready to file it or you can then just file it yourself."

        "transcript": "hey pat and friends welcome back to another video this is the patent and inventing playbook and i'm going to give you all the details that i have on inventing and protecting ideas and inventions with patents and specifically how to tailor a patent strategy for your business or company so stick around we are starting right now [Music] so i'm giving a talk tomorrow at the king county bar association and this is my dry run and i want to record it for uh for all of you so let's kind of get into what we're going to be talking about so first thing is kind of what is patentable sort of where patents fit into intellectual property in general why patents are important i think people realize that patents are you know are valuable things that are important to protecting ideas and inventions but don't really necessarily realize why or at least why it why they're important for say startups for instance i'm going to give you an overview of the patent process and then talk about different patent strategies and specifically talk about patent strategies for big companies for startups for small individual inventors and people with consumer products and how those strategies differ and it's important to understand all of those because regardless of whether you're a startup or an individual inventor you know it's under it's good to understand how these different strategies are the same in some ways and how they're different in some ways so you pick the right one for you also talk a bit about patent or prior art searching whether it's something you need to do whether it's essential whether it's a stand part of the patent process also infringement analysis which is totally different than prior art or patent searching do you infringe on other people's patents is that a standard part of the eventing process and how do you navigate that also early stage issues with inventing and i'm going to talk about this is a really important thing so be sure to stay stick around to the end because i'm going to talk about how to not forfeit your patent rights inadvertently there are some important things you need to do early on to make sure you don't totally forfeit your patent rights or lose the ability to patent something altogether so that's going to be the important thing kind of at the end so for those of you who are new here my name is dylan adams i'm a patent attorney author of the best-selling book patents demystified which is an insider's guide to protecting ideas and inventions um also you may recognize me from my appearance on cnbc's hit show the prophet with marcus lemonis so my practice as a patent attorney is focused on patent prosecution and that's sort of a fancy way of saying i focus on doing patent strategy so determining how to structure a patent portfolio what inventions to protect drafting and filing patent applications following those at the united states patent trademark office and working them through the examination process hopefully until they issue as a patent i do a bit of consulting as well related to infringement litigation so whether it's defense or offense but mostly it's going to be the patent prosecution that is you know crafting patent portfolios and drafting patent applications so as a patent attorney i have to understand technology as well if not better than my client so i have a master's in electoral engineering an undergrad degree in biochemistry molecular biology um and so you know it's you know those are the important things to be able to understand the inventions as well as clients all right so let's go ahead and get right into it so patents are one of four types of ip or intellectual property so you can see here so there's patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets patents and copyrights in a lot of ways are kind of diametrically opposed patents cover utilitarian things whereas copyrights are going to cover artistic works okay trademarks are kind of off on their own they protect things like logos and slogans product names business names and they do do and they do so very specifically in relation to certain goods or services then there's trade secrets which can kind of cover a little bit of everything especially in early stages so for instance trade secrets are a way to protect things before you patent them you keep them secret and then you will file a patent application on it trade secrets can also cover things that you know aren't going to be covered by patents copyrights or trademarks things like formulas and recipes and processes client lists um and you know and sort of know business know-how that's not going to be protected by patents copyrights and trademarks okay so what what is a patent basically what's the basic right of one and that's to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing the invention into the united states and it's important to understand that this is not a right to actually do something so patent again does not give you the right to actually do something it's an exclusionary right and the example i typically give is let's say that you patent a formula of a pharmaceutical or a method of using a pharmaceutical to treat cancer that doesn't give you the right to actually do that you would have to go to the fda and get approval to use the drug in that sort of way so the patent doesn't actually give you the right to do those things okay so that's sort of the the right to exclude or the monopoly and that's sort of the first thing that people think about when it comes to patents but really that's one of the one of the least important things for most companies you know it's not all about enforcing rights it's not about having that monopoly so here are the other things that patents can do for so for instance licensing what you can do is you can allow others to use the patented technology and they'll pay you a royalty or they'll pay you you know upfront fees there's a lot of ways to structure that licensing can you know be totally varied it's really you know any way that you want to do it you retain the rights to the patent but then you give others the right to do it it could be exclusive or non-exclusive that would be licensing the patented technology you can also sell patents as well so that's where you would you would sell the patent that you own to another company it also creates book value in a company as well so that can be used as collateral for for loans or in valuation evaluation so for instance if you're looking for investors how much are you worth as a company to the investors patents are definitely a major part of that so you know aside from those things some of the most important aspects of having a patent or a patent application are these sort of soft benefits that a lot of times people overlook which tend to be the most important in early stages and for early stage companies so the first is a positive marketing purposes so it's going to be positive for attracting investors customers clients and even collaborators and employees patents and a patent application patent portfolio is a great way to mark your company as being innovative as being special and so it's really attractive to folks okay so on the other hand of that it's instilling fear in competitors so just being able to say you're patent pending or you have a patent a lot of times people don't understand what patent pending mean versus patented and you get a lot of benefit in scaring people off you don't even have to enforce your patent rights in order to kind of scare off potential competitors people say well you know it's patented or it's patent pending i i'm hesitant to get into the market you know with with those sort of similar products or technology okay so in addition you get protection against other people patenting similar things so when a patent application publishes or when a patent application issues as a patent it'll become public and these publications can be used against other people when they try to get a patent of their own on similar technology and i'll kind of go into this later on in the patent process but if so let's say somebody files a patent application on something that's really similar a patent examiner would look look at their patent application and they would be very likely to find your published patent application or issued patent that published and be able to reject that patent application saying it's not it's not new or it's obvious in view of prior including your published patent application or patent okay also there's the idea of sort of this ip arms race and so the best uh the best offense is a good defense and so the best way to ward off potential folks who may try to sue you who may have their own patent portfolio is having one of your own okay so it creates a situation where it's sort of the you know the nuclear option where there's mutually assured destruction if everybody sues each other with their patent portfolios so a lot of times these companies will say hey well let's cross license or maybe one company will buy another so the way you can set that up is by having an arsenal of your own patents or patent applications and that can ward off other folks who may have their own patents or patent applications okay so what does it take to get a patent so the main requirements are it has to be patentable subject matter and that's a lot of times fairly simple so you know is it a is it a book or is it a logo well no that's going to be copyrights or trademarks and i'll talk about it in in the next slide but these things that are sort of on the edge are things like abstract ideas and certain types of software so in addition to being patentable subject matter it has to be adequately described in the patent application that's usually a fairly low bar as long as you're working with a patent attorney you have to provide the right details usually not hard to provide it's usually not difficult to do that but you have to provide the right details it's something that you people a lot of times mess up if they try to file provisional or non-provisional patent applications themselves which i'll talk about a bit later on so if people try to do it themselves they don't provide the right details they don't provide enough detail and that can lead to patent applications being rejected so when it really comes down to where the rubber hits the road if you will in the patent examination process examined is going to determine whether the the claimed subject matter is new and non-obvious compared to prior and that's really where all the difficulty comes in the patent process typically that's where the rejections are and that's what either you know is going to make or break the patent application being allowed and potentially issuing as a patent so new or being novel is a question of is there one piece of prior art that totally describes your invention and that could be an issued patent it could be a published pending patent application it could be blog posts scientific papers uh youtube videos i mean really any sort of technology disclosure can be prior art okay so novelty a lot of times yeah there's not gonna be one thing that's exactly like what you have that's why obviousness tends to be really the difficult thing and so the the non-obviousness standard is would it be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that being your average person who works in the field to come to your invention knowing about all the prior that exists and the way it kind of works in examination is the examiner is going to find a bunch of prior art pull elements from and say well okay i found pieces of your invention here i found it here i found it here it would be obvious to combine those things pull all those pieces from this prior and come to your invention and that's the obviousness standard okay so what do utility patents cover really any sort of use useful things utilitarian things so it's mechanical devices software apps web services biotechnology electronics pharmaceuticals manufacturing methods games i mean really the list goes on so another thing i kind of want to talk about is there's a lot of bad information out there about ideas and software being patentable and so you know you'll see stuff online where people say no ideas are not patentable or software is not patentable and i will tell you that is absolutely untrue let me start with software and i'll say one thing is i saw i patent software day in and day out that's the bread and butter of what i do okay but it's all about the language that you use and this kind of gets a little bit technical look at some of my other videos about what patent claims are but so for instance you know i have this example here so you know you you you can't claim a s for instance a software product that performs functions x y and z that's going to be rejected that's you know that's going to be that subject matter eligibility where the examiners say no that's that's not eligible to be patented and will be totally correct so that application will be rejected whereas if you if you if you have a claim to say a computer configured to perform the functions xyz or a computer implemented method that includes the steps of xyz totally patentable okay so that's where the the this question of patenting software you know really kind of gets messed up by patent trees they probably provide the technical answer which is which sure is right that software itself is not literally patentable but aren't providing the good answer that yeah it's it's you can effectively easily patent software and related things that that's not a problem similar to ideas ideas can totally be patentable okay it's only things that are say abstract id ideas or just a formula or or just a a general idea without any details those things can't be patented really that doesn't answer most clients questions like folks come to me and they say hey i have an idea for this product it's going to have these things it's going to have these features and you can fill in the the specific details right remember that's one of the requirements is that you have to have it be adequately described a lot of times it's not that hard to fill in those details and so something that is you know maybe even a rudimentary idea that you know is maybe just sketches on paper that that can totally be patentable assuming those ideas can be filled in okay i mean i've i've definitely filed patent application off of nothing more than scribbles on a cocktail napkin so basic ideas can definitely be patented if you can fill in the relevant details one thing that can be kind of difficult is things like like business methods so things like related to marketing or pricing financial methods a lot of times you know those are seen as just sort of organizing human activity and you know can be rejected and it can be difficult to get those through maybe if it's done on a computer in some sort of special way but you know i really wouldn't worry too much about that stuff if you have something that's utilitarian that is an idea that's software related talk to a patent attorney and ask if it's going to be patentable that's the best way to know whether what you have is going to be patentable or not and a lot of times things that people don't think are patentable totally are going to be okay so let's talk about the two ways to start the patent process and this is going to be really important when planning patent strategy so deciding what application you're going to file first to start the patent process is really critical and if you don't do it the right way you set yourself up for failure early on okay so on this first line here you're going to see you can start with what's called a non-provisional patent application okay so you have an idea you draft and file this formal non-provisional patent application it waits in line for say one to three years at the patent office before examination begins and really that's just you're waiting in line it's a government things are really really slow and the line that you're sitting in is one to three years long that's the only reason why it takes one to three years for examination to begin okay so one of the things to know about this non-provisional application it's the formal application that has to have the formal line drawings has a long detailed description and has to have claims and is going to be typically an attorney drafted sort of you know sort of work product if you're doing it the right way okay so this is really expensive a lot of times it's going to be ten to eighteen thousand dollars to draft and file this application which you know as i'll kind of get to doesn't make very much sense for early a lot of early stage companies okay so getting back to it so far the non-profit waits in line for one to three years examination process begins and that can be months and sometimes another several years of back and forth with the examiner until hopefully the examiner allows the case you pay an issue fee and then it issues as a patent okay so a good way to think about the examination process is it's like any sort of negotiation think about pawn stars or american pickers where you're going to go in with an offer of claims that you know isn't quite what you're entitled to and the examiner is then going to have to you know you're going to negotiate and the examiner is going to say well you know you're not in quite entitled to quite such you know broad claim scope and then you have to kind of come together where you're getting over that hurdle of patentability and hopefully you're getting the broadest claims scope so a negotiation during examination is actually a good thing that's how you get the broadest patent possible okay so that's starting with a non-provisional patent application like i said they're really expensive you know you're paying ten to eighteen thousand dollars a draft to file these things and then you have additional costs the back and forth with the examiner that the attorney has to be involved in that can be thousands of dollars for each response and there can be you know sometimes two three four or more of these responses that your attorney is going to do which is a lot of cost so if only there was a way that you could sort of defer these costs a bit and luckily there is and that's the second uh way to start the patent process and that's the second one down below here so it's starting with what is called a provisional patent application and generally you know you can see that the the process is fairly similar so you have an idea then you'll draft and file this provisional patent application so the nice thing about provisional patent applications is they don't have all these formal filing request requirements it's a it's a document that a lot of times and this is what i do with clients is i will have them draft an invention disclosure that i will then scrub and remove limiting language from do some basic formatting we'll file that as a provisional patent application that can be in the thousands of dollars instead of you know 10 000 and up and can be an easy way to get patent pending status okay so the provisional application it's just a placeholder it only lasts for one year it automatically expires at the end of the year and that term can't be extended that's when you then have to file a non-provisional patent application that claims priority to that provisional application okay and then really the the process is about the same so you know non-provisional waits in line for one to three years before examination begins examination begins and there's a negotiation with the examiner hopefully the examiner allows the case you pay an issue fee and then it issues as a patent so i'm going to get into this a little bit later but it's this can be really important and pretty you know standard in a lot of ways for startups and small companies because with the provisional it can be cost-effective way to get patent-pending status and it gives you a year to do market testing to do r d and then you can add more details at the non-provisional stage another thing we can you can do is and we'll do this frequently is let's say you file the provisional and six months later you come up with all sorts of new things you want to get a priority date for that we'll just file an updated provisional six months down the road and then at the year anniversary from the first provisional we'll file the non-provisional and then maybe even have more updates that's a really great great way to incrementally protect ideas as you're going along as you're doing r d as you work with investors and you know realize that some things work and some things don't that can be really important to sort of you know be able to incrementally protect something instead of just you know say if you were to start with the non-provisional then you would have to file a whole new application every time you come up with something you don't have this you know this window of opportunity to to update things and sort of get uh incremental uh protection along the way okay so let's talk about uh patent strategies of different folks i usually put it sort of into three different buckets one is going to be large patent portfolios and these are folks who are i mean they're refining thousands of patent applications a year if you know hundreds you know sometimes maybe on the low side but it's these are large large patent portfolios the amazons ibm samsung's microsoft's of the world folks like that okay then there are startups and i'll kind of talk about what you know how i define startups um they're sort of growth companies who rely on investors to to grow and they're going to be different than individual in inventors and small consumer products this is going to be maybe it's a you know a large business or a business that has a lot of a lot of products but for small products that themselves don't like make you know don't have a lot of revenue associated with them the the strategy for protecting those things can be very different um just because it's you know you're doing different things than say a startup would same with individual inventors you know who aren't looking to grow and scale they have different needs than startups okay so let's start with the large patent portfolio and and see how we do that okay so you know with with my clients i i work with clients of all sizes whether they be fortune 100 companies startups shark tank companies individual inventors and i deal with all sorts of technology so i have experience with all of these types of clients now you may not be a large company you know like ibm or lg or intel but it's so important to understand their patent portfolio and how that difference differs from what you are going to be doing and why okay so like i said i mean these are folks who are filing say 50 you know 100 if not thousands of patent applications per year and a good way to think about it it's kind of like angel or vc investing and for those of you who aren't really familiar with how angel or vc investing works is they invest in a ton of companies and let's say for instance they they invest in 20 companies they know that the vast majority are going to fail let's say you know 10 out of 20 are totally going to fail they're going to lose their investment on that okay maybe there's going to be another say five companies who are going to maybe break even all right they won't lose their money but they're really not going to make any money then there's maybe 4 out of 20 that maybe they'll do okay they'll make a little bit of money but they're not going to be huge home runs it's really only going to be that one in 20 companies maybe even less that's really the big home run that's the million billion dollar company that really makes these investors a lot of money and that's how these big patent portfolios are kind of created as well you file on you know all sorts of ideas whether they're going to be commercial products or not whether there's just general ideas in in the technology space of the company you file on everything okay so you know you file everything knowing that a lot of stuff is going to be worthless you're just going to lose your money these are going to be you know patents that you know nobody really uses nobody cares about some are going to you know some are going to make a little bit of money whereas it's only going to be maybe the one in 21 and 50 patents it's going to be the million dollar billion dollar patent that really makes a an amazing patent portfolio okay so with these companies they're going to start the patent process with non-provisional patent applications typically they don't need to waste the time and money on a provisional patent application they have the budget just to file the non-provisional they come up with new updates fine we'll file a new non-provisional that that's not a big deal okay so with with with these sort of companies budget is definitely less of an issue and like i said so you just file on everything you file as soon as possible it doesn't matter whether you are you know actually going to be launching the product obviously you would want you know file something before you launch a product and i'll talk about this later on that you lose patent rights upon public disclosures public user office for sale if you don't file a patent application and so they'll certainly do that but a lot of times you know it's you know you invent something file a patent application um and you know and you do that on an ongoing basis all the engineers in the company are finally invention disclosure forms and you're essentially mining new inventions for patents all the time okay and so when you're drafting these applications and going through the examination process it's a focus on high quality enforceable patents and so a lot of times it it makes sense to drag out the examination process you can take a long time and that's okay you want to really negotiate hard to make sure that you have the broadest patent scope possible that's what these companies really want because they want them to be enforceable they want to be able to license them they want to be able to enforce them against competitors so they really want to make sure they're solid assets okay this is important for say like i said cross licensing um defending against people if you need to you know file a lawsuit a counter lawsuit with your patent portfolio or if you need to enforce against somebody who's copying what you have um and for for companies like this the strategy really stays the same the whole time it's not really all that different like i said you're just churning out new patent applications all the time that the inventors are coming up with new stuff and you file patent application just one after each other okay so that's large companies now startup patent portfolio strategy is is is very different so startups are early stage growth companies that scale with investors okay and this these can be companies that are at you know any stage in that process whether it's a friendly self-funded or friends and family funding or you have a seed round where you get a little you know a little bit of capital series a round but really it's going to be a company that's going to grow and then is ultimately going to have some sort of exit strategy right that's going to be being acquired by a company going public something like that and it's going to be an exit where these investors are going to be able to get a return on their investment these are typically not companies they're just going to you know perpetuate and you know be companies ongoing a lot of times they're going to have an exit although sometimes that ends up being the business strategy where these companies you know will just stay in business and don't you know don't go public or or don't actually sell to another company okay so a lot of times these can be small patent portfolios maybe one to ten patent applications per year maybe more than that but a lot of times it's really not that many and for startups i mean you know regardless of where you are on that spectrum of of the lifecycle of a startup budget is always always a concern and that's why i enjoy working with startups the most is because you always have to really do this bespoke work and really be cognizant of the the budget that folks have and be able to scale with that budget in the beginning you have to be really really budget conscious and then you have to you have to leave open options so you can expand the portfolio once you get more capital and then be able to expand it more once you get additional capital that's the fun of working with startups is that it's always changing budget is always a concern and you know worrying about how to craft it for for investors things like that so with with startups they're typically going to focus on protecting the core uh products or or business methods that the that the company has they don't have the budget and the luxury to be able to just patent general sort of white space patenting things around you know their product in the general technology or a lot of times it's going to be fairly focused on their products and a lot of times it will focus on you know the new products they come up with more detail they have in the products that's how you tend to expand the patent portfolio of startups and you have to with with startups you have to sort of build in the ability to scale the patent portfolio with their growth okay that's that's kind of a concern you you want to you know have a lot of description in there so you can file a single big application but later on split that off into continuations and expand the patent portfolio it's a bit sort of out of the scope of this video but i have some good other videos that talk about that sort of strategy of how to scale a patent portfolio as startups grow so the biggest thing with startups is deferring cost and maintaining flexibility that is really really important so you know the name of the game is you know wait as long as you can to file patent applications it's kind of counter-intuitive but it makes a lot of sense to only file when you're about to make public disclosures public uses or office offers for sale or when you're about to uh approach investors that's typically the best time to file patent applications you want to file your provisional patent application then because that defers the you know the time you know of a year that then you have to file that really expensive non-provisional also defines the cost related to the examination process which is also going to be expensive so for startups it's better to wait and delay all of those costs wait until you have more certainty around the product around the market and of course until you have more budget whether it's from investors or actually having sales things like that it's important to make sure you have that capital so you can probably scale the patent portfolio okay so in addition to deferring costs and maintaining this important flexibility you want to craft a patent portfolio for startups to attract investors that's one of the key things about startups is the ip is not really used for enforcing against other folks you know a lot of times startups don't have the bankroll to file patent lawsuits or it's it's typically a a fairly new landscape with new products and there's really there may not even be competitors out there competitors may come in later so the enforcement and having a monopoly really isn't a concern what a concern is is creating a patent portfolio that has good optics and that is is good for marketing to attract investors or other collaborators you know whether they be you know if folks are going to give you grants it's going to be employees it's going to be customers things like that you want to craft a patent portfolio that's going to be attractive to those folks okay so and like i said you're almost always going to be starting with a provisional patent application again that's that's the best way to defer all those costs related to the the expense of non-provisional and related to the uh to the examination process okay so then individual inventors and small consumer products so this is going to be maybe an individual or a small group that doesn't really need investors to grow they can manufacture these products themselves or maybe you know they can you know do it offshore in a factory or something but they but they don't really need investors in order to scale the company okay so you don't have this issue then with having to to attract investors but in a lot of ways the the issues with these sort of companies or with these sort of individuals is fairly similar to to startups okay and and to be honest for a lot of these folks patent applications may not be really be worth it with with startups the optics of having patent applications is extremely important and almost essential you almost have to file patent applications that's how you get traction that's how you get investors it's a key part of the startup life lifecycle whereas for small companies and you know ones where you know they don't necessarily need it for the marketing and optic purposes um you know it may not make a lot of sense to file a patent application at all you know like i said you know it's going to be tens of thousands of dollars a lot of times to get all the way through the examination examination process and if a product really isn't going to have revenue that's going to be more than that it may not make any sense to even file a patent application and that's something that i try to consult on with folks with small products is thinking about well does it even make sense to do this why are you filing a patent application here you know if you're trying to go into it in you know trying to you know be able to enforce a patent you know for small companies that can be really really difficult even startups with a decent amount of capital don't usually have the funds to be able to support big patent litigation they can't even do it it's really difficult for small folks to enforce patent rights but if they're looking for um say patent pending status or patents to scare off competitors or for positive marketing benefits that can be really useful and it can make then a lot of sense to file patent applications okay that can be one of the biggest benefits for those folks but if they're going into it thinking you know hey i want to build in forces that's that's the only thing i'm going to be able to use this patent for you know you may need to think about the return on investment that patents are actually going to give you okay and i want to talk about some issues with sort of these business plans that a lot of folks may have related to just pure licensing or or patenting stuff and selling patents okay so it kind of comes down to the value of ideas so honestly there's very little value in in bare ideas a lot of it is in the execution of the ideas and patenting and and getting value out of uh just bare ideas is you know it's it's really difficult to sell ideas and and and and products that are really complex you know maybe if something is really simple like if you could you know go to home depot and make a prototype or you have stuff around the house where you can make a prototype it's it's really easy to to create and really easy to demonstrate you know then it may you know then it may be totally possible to license or sell something like that the example i always give and you know or the resource that i always refer to folks is as you can see on the slide is stephen key's one simple idea his his book is the number one resource that you know as far as that i've found as far as uh learning how to license and sell ideas and simple inventions um there's definitely a lot to it it's not just something that's really simple like oh yeah i'm just going to go off and i'm going to sell my ideas there's a it's really difficult to do but you can learn how to do it and people can be successful at doing it part of it is picking the right ideas learning how to appropriately approach companies what companies to actually approach um it's you know you can learn those skills but for ideas that are really complex a lot of times that's going to be difficult if not impossible i have folks who come to me all the time say hey i have this idea for a new cell phone app um and i want to go to google and i want to you know i want to tell them about this you know this new website idea or this new app idea things like that it's like well you know a lot of times there's not going to be a lot of value in something like that because the difficulty isn't actually executing that and i think a lot of people don't appreciate how difficult it is to take something from a kernel of idea to do web development to create these things and it can take huge teams of people many years to do it and so folks like google are gonna look like that and be like well yeah i mean okay that's an interesting idea but you know where's the team that's actually going to execute this idea you know i we we you know the value ideas become we we don't we come up with these ideas all the time the value isn't in the idea it's in the execution if you're not a person who can actually execute those things there's really not going to be much value in those things okay so also with you know if for folks who want to patent something and sell issued patents that is extremely extremely risky and not something i recommend as far as a business model goes you know i i think that folks should try to sell things when their their applications are just pending and to be honest if if you don't get traction with selling an invention while a patent application is pending it's very unlikely that you're gonna you know sell it even when it's patented that doesn't really make as much of a difference as you would think a lot of my clients they sell ideas they sell companies they get tons of traction just when things are patent-pending so having an issue patent isn't really you know isn't really important and for the folks who want to go through the whole patent process spend tens of thousands of dollars that's a lot of money to spend that's a lot of risk to take on and it's a long time frame so you know people who i i really don't recommend you know these business plans where people want to just patent something and then try to sell the issued patent a lot of times that's a recipe for for disaster okay so i want to talk about patent and prior art searching and it's a big misconception but patent and prior articulation is not a standard part of the inventing and patent drafting process okay people always think hey and it kind of it's kind of counterintuitive you would think that okay well you know if i'm going to file a patent application i want to know whether it's going to be patentable by doing a prior art search okay and the rationale here is like well so the patent examiner is going to do their own prior search and determine whether the idea is new and non-obvious compared to the priority i should go and i should figure out what the priority is and determine patentability and whether i should even file this patent application surprisingly the value of doing a prior art search and doing it right and having an attorney do it or a search company do it your return on investment is going to be really really low and doesn't typically result in actionable information i mean a lot of times i can draft these uh these letters you know the prior art analysis letters before you even do the analysis okay it's typically going to be hey we found some things that are similar it's hard to tell whether this is you know one examiner or not is going to think that this is you know think this is allowable there's a lot of hidden priority out there and you know we don't really know that's you know 98 of the prior searching that comes back is going to be in that boat you're not going to have anything actionable it's going to be like well let's just file the application which is typically the better thing to do so a lot of it is there's a misconception that you know patents are a binary thing that's either having a patent or not but really patents provide it can provide a spectrum of protection you can have patents that are really broad that cover a lot of different variations or you can have patents that are so specific and so narrow to one very very specific product that they're effectively worthless in the sense that it would almost be impossible for somebody to happen to have a product that was so specific and exact like that's exactly like that or it'd be super easy for them to make some tiny little change and design around that patent okay so that's that's sort of the thing is it's not just you know it's patentable or it's not it's a question of where on that spectrum is it going to be are you going to get be able to get a broad patent is going to have to be really narrow a lot of times you're not going to know where that's going to be even if you do a private search it depends on the exam you get one examiner's gonna say oh yeah this is totally patentable you know i'm gonna give you a really broad patent and it's gonna be really easy for you where's another exam and say well i found a bunch of prior art and i think it'd be obvious to combine you know all of these pieces of prior i can find all the elements of what you have there i'm not going to even let you have a patent at all or i'm going to maybe i'll let you have one but it's going to have to be so narrow and so specific it's going to be effectively worthless you really don't know until you get into examination patentability is definitely in the details of things too so you know people do a prior search on some sort of broad concept it doesn't really do you much good because you don't a lot of times have the specific details of what the product actually is and if you do something a little bit different it may be patentable or you do something different and it may not be patentable it's it's sort of cart before the horse it's better to you know actually create the product and you know maybe then you would do the prior search but then you've already created the product it's better than just to file the patent application so it's it's very card for the cart before the horse you don't have the details when you want to to do the prior search that could actually give you actionable information um you know it typically is better to just file your patent application and let the examiner frame the issues that's the better way to go about it don't spend all the time and all the money on doing some sort of speculative prior art search that doesn't really help you another thing to realize is that a lot of patents are patents and pat or patent applications are held in secret by default for 18 months okay so you could do a prior search but there could be prior that is right there that you know totally is relevant to what you're doing but when you do the search it's it's hidden from you okay so the default is 18 months from when they file the patent application that can be all the way up until the application issues as a patent so there's always going to be this huge blind spot of prior art that you're not going to be able to find it's going to be hidden to you okay so it's another reason why you know it just doesn't make sense to spend all the money and time doing these things um and if and and if you ask me it's a way that patent attorneys upsell upsell their clients they use the fear and people assume it's sort of a standard part of the application process to do this prior essentially to say of course i'll take your money and let's do some patented prior art searching sounds good to me i'm not a big fan of doing that because that doesn't set companies up for success you know only in rare cases where you are going to get a return on investment do i suggest doing patent or prior art searching but when it comes down to it you know honestly especially for for startups and this is going to sound crazy but patentability does not matter let me say that again it doesn't it doesn't really matter a lot of time whether the invention is ultimately patentable and that may sound totally insane to you but let me kind of go back to the patent process again so you file the provisional application it's a year before you file the non-provisional patent application it'll be another one to three years before examination begins and that examination process could be months if not you know years until you get to a final determination that okay this isn't patentable all right so you are you are patent pending during that whole time all right so i've had a lot of clients who they have they have gotten substantial traction by getting big investors closing multiple rounds with investors they have even made x's where they've sold the company or you know or you know somehow you know gone public or something before their patent applications are even issued okay so a lot of times that issue of whether it's patent or not isn't relevant to ultimate success and i've even had folks who end up abandoning their patent applications because we're like look we made the money we want we're getting market traction we don't really need this you know the investors for some reason don't care about it and it it doesn't even matter whether something is patentable okay so you know it that's one of the big misconceptions you know you have to have patents it has to be patentable we need to know that up front it doesn't usually make a difference just file the patent applications that's what's important to investors that's what's important to get you traction not ultimately a lot of times whether it's patentable or not okay the exception though is for simple products where you're really focusing on a single point of novelty things that you know don't have a lot of complexity that's where some prior searching can be useful and i'm not saying that there aren't a few cases where i would recommend doing it but the vast majority of clients that i work with honestly i can't remember the last time i did a patent or prior search as i can't remember you know the last time when you know i wasn't surprised you know when i when i was surprised by the prior that came out was like oh my gosh you know i didn't think that there was going to be stuff like out like that out there there's always going to be prior that's going to be relevant and that's going to be similar it's usually more an issue of you know where you are in that spectrum of protection are you going to be able to get a broad patent or you're going to be able to get a narrow patent that's usually where you fall and so you know a lot of times you know we forego patent searches i mean i would say in 99 of the cases we don't do patent searching at all it makes more sense just to file the patent application another thing to note is that you know this is not the same as market research and i am absolutely not saying that you should not look at other products and not know what's going on in a competitive landscape you know even understanding what other competitors are doing in terms of patent portfolios how they're structuring patents things like that that can be really valuable information but doing all this analysis to determine you know whether your invention is patentable or not whether we should file patent applications that should not be a part of the patent application process but it should absolutely be part of sort of the market analysis uh part of of the business that can be really important and essential in a lot of ways especially when you're pitching to investors they're going to want to know what the competitive landscape is they're going to want to know hey what are other people doing in the in in the field you know what are their products like are they patented they're probably going to want to know those things but again you don't need to do the analysis of whether your invention is patentable or not that's typically not not important okay so it's important to understand the difference between patentability and infringement and what i was just talking about was patentability the question there is are the patent claims in an application new and non-obvious in view of the prior art okay so it's pending applications based on prior art that that that's where you're thinking about patentability okay infringement is something totally different infringement relates to issued and enforceable patents and relates to actual products so the question here is does the accused product or process have all the elements or equivalents of at least one claim of the issued and enforceable patent okay so one thing to note here is that it's only products are actually performing certain methods that's what infringes you know you can have a patent application a patent application does not infringe an issued patent okay writing an article does not infringe on on a on an issued patent it's only when you perform specific methods or you have specific products that meet the elements of the claims of that patent that's when there's infringement and what people will then ask is well hey i'm you know i have this product should i do an infringement analysis to determine whether i'm infringing on somebody else's patents and you know again that's a kind of a you know a natural thing that people would think is something that you would want to do it's like well hey you know i don't want to go out there i don't want to have this product where i'm going to be shut down because i'm infringing on somebody's uh somebody else's patent but strangely enough and counter-intuitively this is not a standard part of the inventing process or part of you know drafting and filing patent applications infringement analysis is absolutely not part of that and strangely enough you know again you don't you don't get you get really low return on investment from all the time and effort you spend on it the the nature of the analysis is really expensive and time-consuming and difficult which you know comes down to you know it being really really expensive in terms of attorney time and a lot of times you know you're really not going to get good actionable information okay so infringement is in the details of the final final product that's what's in really important to understand if you have a general idea for a product you can do this broad patent search but it's going to be in the details of how you actually implement that product or methods related to it and how they compare to the very specific claims of somebody else's issued patent that's where the analysis is and so you can try to do this analysis early on but you're not going to get very good actionable information because you don't have the specifics of the product to compare to the patent claims plus if you're doing this sort of this big broad search you know i mean you're looking at thousands of dollars it's not tens of thousand dollars to do this general search and all this analysis and it's so speculative because you really don't know what your final product is okay also keep in mind you know these applications are secret for 18 months um and potentially all the way up until the patent application issues so you could be doing this infringement analysis you know on pending applications and issued patents but something that's totally relevant could totally you know be hidden from you you may not know it even exists so there's still going to be a huge blind spot even if you're doing you know some sort of uh you know doing some sort of infringement now so you can never know for sure also even if you find patent applications that seem to be relevant those patent applications may never issue as a patent the the you know the the the patent applications they may be rejected and the uh the folks may not be able to get over the rejections or they may just run out of money and give up okay so you know you find these patent applications that are relevant they may never even issue a patent as a patent and may never even be enforceable also keep in mind that the cost to enforce patents is really really really high and so even if you would theoretically infringe on a patent somebody would have to file a patent lawsuit they would have to file an attorney it's a very expensive thing to do and a lot of times people don't have the resources to file a patent application you know unless you know they can have it done on contingency and there's for sure infringement usually infringement isn't a clear-cut thing it's going to be in the gray area and you're going to have good you know non-infringe non-infringement defenses and even in validity defenses that's typical and so you know it it can it can be easy to you know a lot of times shut those sort of lawsuits down so you know the cost to enforce stuff is really really high and so even if you do theoretically uh infringe on something it's not likely that you're actually going to be sued on on the other side of that is let's say you do this big analysis and you say hey we're not infringing any of these patents it doesn't mean you're not going to still be sued i mean i've dealt with litigation where you know people have definitely not been infringing and the people on the other side say well hey we disagree we'll see in court we're going to take this to the very end and it becomes a business decision where it's like well let's just pay these people off they want a small settlement why drag this out this is part of their business plan on you know kind of extorting money out of people with patents and even if there's not really good really good case for infringement a lot of times people can extort money out of people so it doesn't mean that you're going to be free from these infringement lawsuits okay so a lot of times you know just create the best product that you can and if you happen to be one of the rare people who gets caught up in sort of some sort of patent litigation one realize that you know it's it's it's totally rare you you kind of won the crappy lottery but the same time at least you're on somebody's radar as a successful company that's a good problem to have you know a lot of times people aren't even on anybody's radar they wouldn't know you know what you're doing whatsoever okay there's there's an exception for a targeted analysis if for instance you have a there's one competitor that you are really aware of and you know about specific patents then it can make sense if it's if it's really targeted to a specific patent or maybe a specific competitor especially if for instance you you are really using a lot of what they're doing as inspiration um you may want to be really careful about what you're doing and if you know that you're trying to design around certain products or patents then you may want to do some sort of infringement analysis and it can make sense a lot of times for larger companies who who know that they're going to be devoting a lot of money to these products so for individuals who have a small product you know it's it's it's prohibitively expensive to do this sort of analysis you know a lot of times you know doing the search is going to be you know as much as is probably your revenue for you know for a long period of time so you don't get a good return on investment also for startups well you know they don't necessarily know what their product is initially they don't have the the money to do these sort of analyses i want to finish off with talking about the early stage issues and these are some of the most important things that you need to know when it comes to inventing and developing ideas the first is you have to understand that you should not make public disclosures public uses or offers for sale until you file a patent application so patent might start to be lost upon a first public disclosure public use or offer for sale in nearly all foreign countries you automatically lose your rights upon a first public disclosure public use or offer sale in the u.s and some foreign jurisdictions you have a a one-year grace period or maybe a six-year grace period where you know you have to file a patent application within that time period otherwise you lose your rights but a lot of times you automatically lose your right so the so the best way to do it is file you a patent application again before a first public disclosure public use or offer for sale all right you should also file be taught before talking with investors and a lot of times this isn't going to be considered a public disclosure public use are for sale that's going to forfeit patent rights but it really improves your pitch with investors okay so you can go into the pitch meeting saying hey we're patent pending and you can be more open and talk to them about the technology that can be really important okay it makes you know it makes things a lot more comfortable it improves the the pitch substantially what you don't want to do is go in and say well hey you know we're gonna file patent applications i can't talk about this i want you to sign an nda and you know hopefully you know this but that is totally pegs you as a newbie who doesn't know what they're doing in the eyes of investors they're gonna look and be like hey we we don't want to work with you you know this is this is not a legit company um that you know they're they're you know they don't understand how things work okay so you know you you ideally then should just hey file a patent application go in be able to say your patent pending all right so you got to understand that the us is no longer a first to invent system and you would think that that would mean hey we need to rush and file patent applications immediately but like i said earlier on that's not the case a lot of times it makes more sense to wait and file defer the costs related to filing that initial provisional application to filing the non-provisional a year later to the examination process so again there's the it's the four triggers public disclosures public uses offers for sale and before you're going to approach investors that's typically when i recommend folks actually file patent applications okay and this one is really really important probably one of the most important things that i'm going to talk about is that inventors must affirmatively assign their patent rights to a company okay so just by being an employee just by being a partner in the company or you know being a contract contractor things like that that does not automatically mean that those inventors are required to assign their patent rights and what can happen is you file a patent application this person says well i never assigned my patent rights we don't have any employment agreement or any sort of any sort of contract or you know in a collaboration group that says i assign my rights i'm going to hold on to this and then you effectively you know lose control over the patent that person owns a share of the patent and they can go out and they can you know they can license the technology around your back without your permission okay so you lose control and obviously that is really unattractive makes you radioactive in the eyes of investors you want to make sure that you don't do that it's really easy to protect yourself all you have to do is in any sort of agreement you have again whether it is employment agreement a collaboration agreement partnership agreements that all patents and ip that's generated goes to the company you just have a clause that says you know i hereby assign my you know my rights in any uh in any patentable subject matter to the company it's usually a pretty simple clause talk to your attorney about it but usually it's pretty simple but you have to have that in there before you start collaborating with people okay so with all these things talk to a patent attorney early so you know you have a software product or you have a uh you have an idea is that patentable talk to the patent attorney a lot of times it can be free or it can be really really cheap to do an analysis and to plan out a strategy about hey is this patentable am i ready to file a patent application on this okay talk to a patent attorney early it makes a lot of sense just to make sure that you're not you know forfeiting your patent rights but inadvertently doing something like public disclosures public user offers for sale that are going to forfeit your patent rights and that it's very goldilocks you know you want to make sure that you're filing at the right time you're not filing too early but you're not filing too late okay so thanks for watching and check out some of these other videos um i got a couple of other ones here that are going to be really good additions to this thanks for watching and we'll see you again in the next video thanks"

        "transcript": "hey pat and friends i'm going to be giving a talk at the king county bar association here in seattle and i wanted to record a video of my practice run for this because it has some good information that is important for inventors entrepreneurs and startups the the talk is actually called um intro to patents for non-patent attorneys but it's actually really relevant to um a lot of folks not necessarily just uh attorneys or you know especially non-patent attorneys um so you know they didn't let me uh um actually record the actual presentation um they're keeping that one as a proprietary uh channel content for themselves so i figured i would record this practice run for you so for those of you who are new here my name is dylan adams i'm a patent attorney and i'm the author of the best-selling book patents demystified which is an insider's guide to protecting ideas and inventions used by inventors entrepreneurs and startups worldwide including at top universities like harvard stanford and mit you might also recognize me from my appearance on cnbc's hit show the prophet with marcus lemonis so this channel typically i have smaller videos you know ranging from say like five ten to you know 20 minutes this one's gonna be a bit longer since it's uh a talk that i'm actually doing you know helping people get cle credit um for attorneys but yeah check out the rest of channel and be sure to subscribe for more on patent startups this channel typically gives you information all the insider stuff that i use with my clients on a daily basis whether they be fortune 100 companies shark tank companies or or startups so all right let's go ahead and get right into it [Music] so what are we going to be talking about in this video so we're going to give you an overview of patents and the patent process and specifically like how patents relate to other sorts of intellectual property that's kind of an important place to start patents are one type of analog actual property and it's good to know where patents fit in with those other types also why should you even care about patents i think people realize that patents are important but surprisingly there's a lot of reasons why you should care about patents that aren't necessarily intuitive and then also for those attorneys out there how to counsel clients on patents and for those of you who are uh clients yourselves at that being you know if you're an inventor entrepreneur or startup it'll kind of give you a sense of you know how to understand patents uh yourself so also understanding what a patent covers people look at the drawings they look at the description they assume that that's what covered that's actually not the case and this video is going to show you you know what actually is covered by patents and how to determine that not always understood by people this video is going to kind of give you the answers on that as well and then also the patent filing and examination process is going to give you the whole layout of that and also discuss the important distinction between patentability and infringement a lot of people use those words interchangeably there's a really important distinction between those words and this video is going to give you that as well okay so like i said my name is dylan adams i am a partner and i'm a patent attorney at the firm of davis right tremaine and you know it's kind of helpful to step back and sort of get a sense of like okay what do i do as a patent attorney what is my job really like and that kind of informs the patent process one of the things is so i have a focus in patent prosecution which sounds like litigation but what patent prosecution actually is it's going to be preparing patent applications so drafting patent applications filing them at the united states patent and trademark office and then working them through the examination process that's what patent prosecution is i tend not to use that term because it's easily confused like i said a lot of people think that relates to litigation or something i do some litigation i you know work with patent litigators but primarily my job is going to be you know planning patent portfolios drafting patent applications and filing them at the uspto now an important thing to understand about patent attorneys is they have to have a technical background my background is in biochemistry like molecular biology i also have a master's in electrical engineering so i do a lot of stuff in the computer realm i do a lot of robotics a lot of mechanical devices consumer products a little bit of everything um and you know i have to understand the technology as well if not better than than my clients that's why patent attorneys are gonna have this technical background okay so let's start off with the with the four types of intellectual property which are patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets now patents is gonna be the focus of this video but it's important to understand sort of where patents fit in with the other types of ip or intellectual property so patents versus copyright so copyrights are going to cover all sorts of artistic works so things like books movies uh paintings musical works like like songs um you know uh artistic works like a sculpture all those are gonna be covered by copyright and that's in stark contrast to patents which cover useful articles there's a wide variety of things that are considered useful articles that are you know covered by patents and a lot of times you know it's not always intuitive like for instance things like clothing clothing is you know obviously a very artistic thing but the law considers clothing to be a useful article and so design of clothing is covered by patents other examples are things like computer technology biotechnology consumer products pharmaceuticals and we'll kind of go over some more of the things that are covered by patents but the main thing is you know patents and copyrights are sort of diametrically opposed patents cover useful things and utilitarian things and copyrights cover artistic things now then there's copyright so copyrights copyrights are going to cover logos it's going to cover slogans it's going to cover the names of businesses the names of products and trademarks are intimately associated with goods and services that's the most important thing to understand about trademarks um so you know it's it's not just you can get a trademark in general on a slogan or a name it's intimately associated with specific goods or services related to that mark whether it's going to be a name whether it's a logo whether it's a slogan okay now the fourth type of intellectual property is trade secrets so trade secrets really anything that can be held in secret that isn't publicly known things like formulas recipes processes client lists and when you're developing technology sort of in the early stages before you've made it public a lot of those things can be covered by trade secret so those are the four types of intellectual property so let's turn to patents then and focus on those so what is the basic right of a patent so it's to you you have the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or selling the adventure throughout the united states or importing the invention into the united states and it's important to know that it's you don't actually have a right to do something specifically it's actually a negative right so like i said it's the right to exclude others from making using selling okay so to give you an example so for instance like let's say you get a patent on a drug that is used for treating cancer okay so you have you have a you have a patent on that sure you could exclude others from making using selling offering to sell maybe that drug or performing the process of treating folks with that drug but it doesn't give you the right to actually do that so to be able to actually treat people you know with that drug you you actually have to approve from the fda right so that's a good example of why patents don't actually give you the right to do anything they give you an exclusionary right to stop others from making using selling offering to sell um and so you know along along with you know the patent rights you know this ends up not being really the most important thing when it comes to patents a lot of times people think hey i want to get a patent because i want to stop people from doing things and yes that is the the basic right of patents that is the core of what patents are but especially for inventors and entrepreneurs and startups that's actually surprisingly the least important part of you know what patents actually do for you so yes i mean patents can give you a monopoly over you know a certain sort of claim technology for a certain period of time typically 15 20 years depending on what sort of patent it is but having a a patent or a patent application you can license that technology that is you can allow others to use it and maybe get royalties um you know maybe you know get a you know get a lumps you know lump lump sum payment things like that a lot of different types of licensing as you probably already know you can also sell patents so for instance you can you know instead of a license where you're allowing maybe one party or multiple parties you're giving them the right to to use something and you still own the patent you could potentially sell the patent patents can be quite valuable patents also give you a book value that can be considered value in a company so for instance you know if you have a patent portfolio of 10 patents and let's say each one is worth a million dollars you may be able to get a loan based on the value of your patents or maybe be able to get investment based on the value of those patents in a company so just holding those assets can be extremely valuable for folks but really one of the most important things though is sort of the mar the positive marketing purpose of patents being able to say you're patent pending or you have a a patent or patent portfolio that's really attractive to a lot of folks so it could be attracted to potential customers you know you can say it's patent pending or it's patented technology that differentiates you in the market and makes people say hey you know this is something special this is a product that is different that was awarded a united states patent and so that's one of the things that you know can set companies aside or set products you know set them apart from their competitors is being able to say that the technology is patented or or or patent pending along with that you can attract folks like investors investors love patents a lot of times you know one of the main things you know that's part of the deal is going to be the intellectual property and specifically the the patent portfolio that can be important you know with getting investors and extra strategies selling to companies having having patents is really important uh to that aspect as well so you know along with customers and investors it's also really important in attracting employees employees will see your company you know for potential employees so potential employees they see your company as being innovative and innovative you know you're not just you know creating boring technology you're creating important stuff that's patented or that that's patentable you're cutting edge and you're innovative and a lot of folks want to work for companies like this they want to get patents themselves and see that as like hey you know i'm getting in on something that's uh that's going to be important for me and my career and i'm working with a company that's doing interesting things so aside from the positive benefit you know this positive benefit for employees or potential employees investors folks like that you also in steer instill fear in competitors and this is not you know actually suing people or sending people cease and desist letters there's a lot of benefit just by saying that you're patent pending or having published patent applications talking about your your patent portfolio talking about patented technology a lot of times if it's patent pending people don't know what's patented and what's not patented typically it's because it's not you're not able to look up the pending patent application and if even if folks do a lot of times it's hard to know what is protected and what's not especially when the application is pending a lot of people don't realize that the the claims are not set in stone when an application is pending and that the application may not even ever issue as a patent a lot of people are scared to get into a market when a competitor has something that's patent pending or that's patented they have a hard time understanding what's protected and they a lot of times would just say well let's not get into that market or let's not have a product that's that's competing if we are going to do something let's do something completely different so just having uh the you know patent pending status that ends up being one of the most important things especially for early stage companies like inventors entrepreneurs and startups and also there's the benefit of having defensive publication so we kind of you know mentioned sort of the offensive benefit of patents where you can stop people from doing things or you can scare other folks but there's also the defensive capability so by default patents are held in secret for 18 months and at 18 months unless you file a non-publication quest the the patent application will publish and it'll be publicly available and there's a huge bend to that benefit to that because that can be used as prior art against other people trying to patent cert similar things and we're going to kind of go over what priority is and the examination process later on but i'll kind of give you the basics here so you can understand why this is so important so for instance in the patent examination process typically the examiner is going to use published patent applications or issued patents as prior against other people's patent applications sure you know things like blog posts or your actual product could be prior art but a lot of times patent examiners aren't going to take the time to find that sort of prior art and i've seen this a lot i've done litigation like this where folks have been selling a product or um you know they've been working on this technology and they have they didn't patent their person their their shelves but somebody else went out there came up with something similar and patented it such that it actually covered what what you know what their product was um and what ended up happening is that the pan examiner didn't know about the previous products or maybe the products were held in secret or something and so somebody else patented something that you know you know covered covered their product had they filed a patent application and had it published the patent examiner would have likely found that use that against the other person who ended up getting the patent and would have stopped the issues like being you know this company being sued for uh sued for infringement so there's a lot of defensive benefit to filing patent applications and that's that's that's true even if the patent application is pending and honestly even if the patent application never issues as a patent so for instance if it publishes that's prior art forever that's always publicly available and that prior can be used against folks even if it's a pending application and examination still going on or even if you decide to let the application go abandoned and it never issues as a patent so that's something that a lot of folks don't think of either is that you solve a lot of problems by just having your patent application publish and a good way to think about patent protection it's kind of like an arms race that you know if you if you have a competitor and they have patents it's good to file your own patent applications because if you have some patented technology you can potentially use that against them and maybe some of their products if they happen to accuse you of patent infringement and a lot of times it doesn't come to lawsuits a lot of times you know these companies will cross-license things or come to some sort of agreement or decide to leave each other alone knowing that well it's going to be a nuclear option we both have big patent portfolios and if one of us sues the other one hey there's going to be cross suits for patent infringement and this is going to get expensive there's no benefit in doing that so either let's come to some agreement and cross license things or let's decide to work together and just sort of leave each other alone and work in different spaces so what are the requirements to get a patent and there's really four main requirements one is it has to be patentable subject matter and so what that kind of means is so it has to be the thing that can be patentable or is that is eligible for for for being patented so for instance if you come up with a a new song or if you write a book well that's going to be the subject of copyright and so that kind of thing is not going to be patentable but let's say you come up with some software or you come up with a new consumer product hey that's the kind of thing that can be patented so you know that ticks the box for being a patentable subject matter second thing is that has to be adequately described in the patent application and the big mistake that a lot of folks make especially when filing provisional patent applications we'll get into a provisional versus non-provisional patent applications um in a bit is that people don't provide adequate description so there's there's not um an enabling disclosure of the technology so the requirement is that you must describe the technology in sufficient detail such such as such that the average person in the in the art your average person who kind of works in the field they can make and use the invention just based off of your description and maybe the drawings that you provide and that's the problem that a lot of folks if they do it themselves that they run afoul of is that they'll just say file an abstract or you know file a one-line uh or you know two-line patent application saying ah well this kind of describes what i'm doing well it's not an enabling disclosure um and then what ends up happening is you know people have worthless protection or uh the patent application will you know totally die in the examination process because it's not uh fully enabled okay so a lot of times those things are pretty easy to to deal with when you're working with a patent attorney um those don't tend to be issues but the the next two substantive aspects of patentability are that it the the claim technology is new and non-obvious okay and so let's talk about those two things so new is the question is is there one piece of prior art out there whether that's say a scientific paper or an existing product a pending patent application that published an issued patent application it could be a youtube video a blog post is there is there one technology disclosure that describes everything you have claimed um for your invention and a lot of times there's going to be something different between your invention and somebody else a lot of times people don't aren't going to describe the exact same thing and usually the the novelty requirement that's you know that can usually be fairly easy to go over what the difficult uh standard is is that the technology must be non-obvious so non-obviousness is a requirement that in view of all known prior art and we kind of you know i mentioned kind of what priority is um you know knowing all the prior art that you know exists you know like i said whether it's issued patents published patent applications youtube videos existing products all that would it be obvious to come to your claimed invention given everything that's already known and the way that it sort of practically works in the examination process the examiner sort of takes elements from these different pieces of prior and combines them and says well okay you know one single one single piece of prior it doesn't disclose all these things but if you kind of pull some stuff from here if you pull some stuff from here and you pull some stuff from here you can come to your invention and your invention is is obvious and so that's where obviousness rejections come from so those are the four requirements of patentability so again it's it has to be a patent of a subject matter it can't be something that's not patentable like say books or it can't be uh you know a a logo things like that that would be copyrighted trademark has to be adequately described you have to have a full description of the technology and a lot of times i mean this is going to be you know i work on applications all the time that you're going to be you know a hundred pages or more that's not atypical usually these are very detailed descriptions like i said earlier you know i have a technical background i have to write very detailed technical descriptions of stuff that you know that that you know engineers and scientists would understand um and then the the claim dimension has to be new and non-obvious okay so let's kind of talk about some issues when inventing and developing uh technology sort of the early stages of things and this is going to be something important um and kind of you know for the for the attorneys out there you know if you're going to be counseling clients you want to be thinking about these things in early stages a lot of times the client is going to come to you and say hey you know i i have this business or you know i'm thinking about this product you know these are the things you want to be thinking about in terms of patent issues and stuff that you can kind of give them basic counseling on and something you probably want to refer off to a patent attorney who's kind of a specialist in these things so one of the most important things is that patent rights start to be lost upon a first public disclosure public use or offer for sale of the of the technology and this is one thing that people make them make mistakes on all the time is that you know they they launched the product they've been selling for and they're like this is great i should patent this but they've been selling for over a year and so they've forfeited their patents in the united states and upon the first public disclosure republicans are offered for sale they forfeited their rights in foreign countries and that's kind of the important thing or important thing to understand is that so the u.s gives you a one-year grace period so in the us you have one year from your first public disclosure public use or offer for sale to file a patent application otherwise you lose your patent rates effectively the technology becomes dedicated to the public but you in pretty much any foreign jurisdiction you're automatically going to lose your rights upon a first public disclosure public use or offer for sale and that's why best practice is to file a patent application before you do any public disclosures public uses or offers for sale and that's something you should kind of counsel clients on is hey you know before you make any public disclosures you know be sure to file a patent application as i'll kind of discuss later on typically it's going to be most cost effective and you know time effective as well to file what's called a provisional patent application another thing and and like i said you know you want to file before a first published disclosure publisher offer for sale but another event that is kind of important to file a patent application before is before talking with investors now a lot of times when you talk with investors this isn't going to be considered a public disclosure public use or offer for sale these are at least implied confidentiality situations but at the same time it's it's pretty important to file a patent application before talking to investors um just because of kind of the practicality of practicalities of things so one of the issues is you want to be able to go into the meeting and it helps your pitch people say hey the technology is patent pending right it really helps the it helps the pitch and being able to be open about what the technology is you know anybody who works in this sort of startup space knows that people who are asking investors to sign non-disclosure agreements investors are not going to want to do it they're going to be insulted and they're going to see you as being a newbie and you're probably going to be rejected as a result so the better thing to do is file a patent application go in say your patent pending you know be friendly about it don't you know get in somebody's face say hey i'm patent pending you know don't mess with me and my idea right now be friendly about it um but you know use that instead of having people sign non-disclosure rooms that's a far better way to handle things and so that's why i typically say you know file a patent application before talking to investors it really improves the pitch and allows you to go in and talk freely about the invention because you have a priority date before you talk to the investors and so you know that you're protected before talking to them okay so another thing to note when when developing things in kind of the early stages is the united states is no longer a first to invent system so back in 2013 we came to parity with the rest of the world where priorities given to the person who files a patent application first not the person who invents first the way it used to work was if you could show that you invented something before somebody else did it didn't matter whether they filed their patent application first you would get priority based on your early inventorship but the rest of the world never worked that way and the united states finally in 2013 just decided to you know come to parity with the rest of the world and so we are now a first to an in invent system so that's kind of something important so and it kind of raises a couple issues one is you want to file as as soon as practical but you don't want to file too early the the best time of files like i said is before you're right before you're making public disclosures public user offers for sale or before you're talking to investors um so you know why why why is it good to wait a lot of times you know if you file too early you're going to be setting yourself up for costs too soon one you know even if you're starting with a provisional patent application there's a lot of cost associated with that especially if you're going to be working with attorney and it's better to delay that um two you file a provisional and then you have to file a non-provisional a year from then which we'll kind of talk about uh in a bit and non-provisional patent applications that are done right are going to be quite expensive so if you can wait to file your initial provisional patent application you're also then going to then going to delay the cost of filing that non-provisional patent application and trust me that you file a provisional and that year that the provisional is pending that goes by really fast for startups people think oh my gosh a year that's you know that's so far down the road but that goes by super super fast and a lot of times you know hopefully the company is getting some more traction hopefully and they have investors but a lot of times you know that year goes by and suddenly the company is kind of on the hook to have to file this expensive non-provisional patent application and if they're not ready for it it's going to be costs that they're going to have to come out of people's individual pockets we're going to kind of going to come out have to come out of funds that really should be allocated to other places okay so another thing that is really important to understand in the early phases is that inventors have to affirmatively assign their rights to inventions to the company and so let me step back and kind of give you some some background on that so in a patent application the the true inventors have to be named that's one of the requirements of a patent application anybody who made an inventive contribution to the subject matter has to be named in the patent application and it's not like things like copyright where a employer employee relationship a lot of times that can be considered work for hire and so there's sort of an automatic ownership in the company it doesn't work like that with with patents so with patents the inventors have to firmly assign their rights and typically this is going to be done in some sort of employment agreement a contractor agreement collaboration agreement where these these inventors or potential investors sign a contract that includes a clause that says i hereby sign any patent rights to any adventure that i come up with to your company and that should be done early on with any sort of collaboration with any sort of employees anybody that's really collaborating with the company there should be an assignment clause in in their contract so that later on if they happen to come up with inventive subject matter then the rights are already assigned you don't have to deal with the issues of inventors not wanting to assign their rights because there's no requirement for them to do that i see this issue a lot where people say yeah we're excited we want to file a patent obligation and i said okay well great well you know where are the you know i want to see the contracts that say these inventors are required to assign assign their rights and they say oh we well we didn't do that as they have to go back and they talk to the inventors and then the inventors say oh well this company is starting to get traction you're going to file patent applications there's there's value here well i want to get paid more you know or i refuse to sign i own the rights to this right and that can cause a lot of problems um one it can make it so that you know you really can't file the patent applications or you have split ownership issues and then investors hate that that's a that's a huge liability sort of those random owners who are the inventors they can go off and they can license they can sell they can they can allow other people to you know make and use the technology they can allow others to sell the technology they can do it themselves and you can't do anything about it so make sure you tie up assignment rights early on okay so one thing is you know definitely talk to a patent attorney early in these things um you know so for instance you know if if you're not comfortable with a lot of these patent issues a lot of times you can have a patent attorney do a free consultation for folks i tend to give folks a free half an hour hour of a consultation a lot of times you can suss out the major issues and do some kind of planning about you know how and when you're going to start filing patent applications whether things are patent what kind of the chances of whether things are patentable a lot of times that can be done you know within a half an hour to an hour and a lot of times patent attorneys they're going to do those things for you so feel free to you know engage with patent attorneys early it makes a lot of sense to kind of get involved in the process uh you know with patent attorneys as soon as possible and even if you're not going to be filing patent applications immediately it's good to have these things in mind and especially if people kind of forget the issues with public disclosures and with inventorship and all that it's good to sort of you know talk those things through with a patent attorney early on okay so another thing i sort of want to mention too is that there's the there's this misconception out there and especially online i've seen this where people say well ideas or software can't be patented and and and i would have to say that that is completely untrue and i've had a lot of people you know kind of say oh you know i came up with the software and well you know i i didn't patent it because well you know i know that software isn't patentable it's like well it totally is um you know i i work and i patent software day in day out that's the vast majority of my practice just like ideas a lot of people say well you know i've heard that abstract ideas aren't patentable and so i i don't know about this idea it seems kind of abstract i'm just not going to patent it so you know don't make those determinations on your own talk to a patent attorney about your technology especially when it comes to ideas and software so for instance i'll give you an example with with ideas so true there is case law that specifically says that okay you know abstract ideas aren't patentable but that doesn't really answer the true question that folks have is they say hey i have an idea for a product and you know the product would do these things and here is how it would work that's totally patentable as long as you can describe that insufficient details such the average person can make and use that idea and what they're really asking is is my concept for a you know for this product is is that patentable could i file a patent application now and the answer is yes as long as you can provide sufficient detail are bare ideas patentable no typically not it's going to be in the details of how things are done but what i do with a lot of folks especially if they don't necessarily know what they're going to do their early stages and we have to file a patent application you know as somebody with a technical background you know i can fill in those gaps for people like that's something that patent attorneys do a lot of times and a lot of times you can just kind of make stuff up you don't have to know exactly what you're going to do you're not held to one specific way and say well i have to know which specific way i'm going to do this you can talk about all sorts of different alternatives okay so don't ever bind this thing that ideas aren't patentable and similarly with software so the law technically says yes software is not patentable but this is one of the problems with communication with attorneys especially is they talk about these technicalities of law but they're not really answering somebody's question so for instance like i have folks coming out all the time and say hey i have this software for a a cell phone app is that patentable so okay yes technically the software itself is not patentable but a a cell phone configured to perform functions you know a b c and d with you know with the method of elements a b c and d that is totally patentable or a you know a method of um you know you know doing something rather having the steps of x y and z that is patentable or a non-transitory computable readable medium as in like you know a computer memory that when executed by a processor performs steps x y and z well that can be patentable well as well so okay so you know yes you can't claim a piece of software that does xyz but you can effectively claim software by claiming a device that you know performs certain steps a method of doing something or the memory you know a computer memory that stores instructions for doing x y and z so that's why a lot of folks you know you give bad advice when it comes to um saying well software isn't patentable and even though that is technically correct um it's really not effectively true it doesn't really answer folks true questions about whether their software-based product is actually patentable or not okay so when it comes to patents it's important to understand that there are two main types of patents there are design patents and there are utility patents so when it comes to utility patents and design patents they you know it's kind of a misnomer in some ways because utility patents actually do cover uh designs utility patents cover designs of things with a physical configuration of things design patents cover one specific ornamental design of an artic article of manufacture so here here's some examples of design patterns and design patterns are really really diverse any useful articles so you know whether it's electronics it could be you know i have the example here of like there's firearms sunglasses a computer keyboard figurines things like that those things can be protected by design patents and design patents cover one specific design of things so really it's going to be essentially just drawings these black and white line drawings as you can see in this example it's going to be different views of that that's what a design patent covers so in contrast a utility patent application i'll kind of give you a sense of that as well so utility patents cover you know systems so physical things or they can protect methods of doing things and the big difference between design patents and utility patents is that utility utility patents uh have claims that is you know what defines the meats and bounds of protection that's in words and so here's a good example so on the on the on on on the on the right side here so you have this design patent for this kind of this weird wrench hammer thing that has a nail pry bar at the bottom so a design patent would have different views of this and would protect this specific design so you could potentially protect this with a utility patent application as well so here you would have a claim that is in words and so it's a tool comprising a hammer head a wrench slot and a first nail puller at one end of an extended shaft and a second nail puller at a second end of the shaft so you know that's sort of a way of describing this thing in words and the big difference here is that describing words there can be a lot of different shapes for that right so you know for instance like the hammer head itself like that could be square instead of being around it could be a lot of different shapes in that and you know for instance it could be really long it could be really short the the nail pullers could you know be sort of different shapes and sizes a design pattern is going to be very specific to this one design whereas a utility patent can cover things um a lot more you know in a lot more varied varied way it's it's just important to understand really basically there are utility patents and design patents again talk to a patent attorney about what is available a lot of times utility patents are going to be what you're going to want and every once in a while you're going to have design patents to be applicable and then sometimes too it's going to be both you know you're going to want to file both a design patent application and a utility patent so utility patents versus design patents they both have their pros and cons so utility patents like i said they cover a an idea or product very generally it can be very broad protection but at the same time it's a lot more expensive these are the applications that tend to be you know in the tens if you know maybe hundreds of pages um compare design patterns which are just you know some line drawings and a one page of description um for so for utility patents and we'll kind of get into this patent process it can take any for where from two to five years or more from when you start the patent application process for uh for patents to issue it takes a long time for utility patent application to issue and they're a lot more difficult the examination process you know is is a lot more arduous there's a lot more back and forth with the examiner and that's one of the things that makes it more expensive as well whereas design patents a lot of times they're almost guaranteed to go through and there's really not much of an examination process that makes them a lot more or less expensive in terms of one you know sort of the the content of the application really like i said it's just line drawings and one page description compared to you know tens if not hundreds of pages of really detailed description and design patent applications are going to be examined and issued a lot faster a lot of times this can be within 6 to 18 months which is a lot faster than utility applications like i said design patents are going to be almost always allowed it depends on the design but a lot of times it's not all that difficult to get design patent applications through so the rest of time we're going to be talking about utility patent applications and again that's because utility patent applications are the main type of application that you're going to be filing that's i would say 95 of time utility patent applications are are what's going to be applicable so that's going to be the the discussion kind of for the rest of it there are two ways to start the patent process and this graphic kind of shows both them one is to start with what is found called a non-provisional patent application and that is the the formal patent application that has all the formal requirements of very specific types of formatting and for the drawings and for the description and tends to be a pretty expensive application you file this application at the united states patent trademark office and it takes anywhere from one to three years before the examination process begins and this is just it's just because of the government the government you know is is slow they have a big backlog and the backlog is essentially one to three years long so you're just really waiting in a big long line for the patent examination process to begin so the patent application process begins an examination is like a negotiation so the examiner is going to perform a prior art search and determine whether what you have claim is new and non-obvious and then you have a negotiation where you're trying to convince the examiner that what you have claimed is new or not obvious or maybe you can even amend the patent claims to define something that is that is new and non-obvious only this examination is successful um and a patent will will issue okay so that is starting with a non-provisional patent application so the other option is to start with what is called a provisional patent application so provisional patent application it is just a placeholder it only lasts for one year and this kind of this is shown on the bottom here so provisional patent application it lasts for only one year it expires the end of the year you can't extend that term and that's when you have to file the non-provisional patent application and then really the process is is essentially the same so again you have from the non-privilege you have you know one to three years um you know before examination begins and then it can be you know several years before you know before the the application issues if ever assuming the negotiation of examination is successful so why would you choose a provisional versus a non-provisional patent application so when it comes to startups and early stage companies it almost always makes sense to start with a provisional patent application and there's a lot of reasons for this a lot of it is because the provisional patent application it can it's it's a lot less expensive um it doesn't have all the formal requirements that a non-provisional patent application does i mean a lot of times what i'll do is i'll have the inventors draft a detailed description and maybe provide some drawings of what the technology is and i can then format that and edit that and file that as as a provisional patent application a lot less expensive than having to have me draft you know these long you know maybe tens if not hundreds of pages worth of description and drawings that tends to be a lot more expensive because there's a lot more attorney time involved in that also it provides a lot of flexibility so being able to file a provisional patent application that protects one version of of of the technology at that filing date and then at the non-provisional states in a year then you can add updates to that otherwise if you file the the non-provisional application first and i'll kind of go back to this uh this slide that shows the difference if you file that you start with a non-provisional application if you come up with new new aspects of the technology which trust me i mean especially in early stage client companies doing r d and things there's always going to be updates to the technology that's always going to happen even when people say oh well no we're pretty sure that this is the final version um you know we're not going to be doing anything different you know you get it in front of customers you start doing r d on stuff and things sometimes dramatically change what ends up at the end of that year sometimes is completely different even what we file the provisional patent application on it doesn't at all cover what ends up um you know being the the final invention so the benefit of filing provisional patent applications is it allows you to incrementally incrementally protect things you get to you know to protect things at the provisional stage and then add new things at the non-provisional stage sometimes what we'll even do too is we'll file a first provisional patent application maybe in six months okay you're getting it from in front of customers you're coming up with new stuff you're doing more r d and investors get involved never say hey we want to add these new features there's a lot of inventing that goes on and we even file a second provisional patent application six months down the road then a year from the original patent a provisional patent application will file the non-provisional and that will even include more updates and more additions to it so finding a provisional patent application is a great way to incrementally protect things also like i said it delays the the expensive cost of the non-provisional patent application and the cost of the examination process yes it slows things down and that's kind of what you can see here is there's a you know there's a year of extra time that doing the provisional patent application ads because of that one year provisional term and a lot of people say oh well that's bad because having the non-provisional having an issue as soon as possible is good i want to be able to enforce it right away that's kind of counter-intuitive it's actually a lot of times better to allow things to remain pending one of the big things is you know delay the cost you know you you don't want to incur the cost of the non-provisional or the examination phase early than you absolutely need to delay those costs your your your budgets go to other things ideally and having the patent in hand okay yes you can say that you're patented and that's maybe a bit more of a benefit when it comes to say investors or things but you know a lot of times it's going to be really difficult and expensive to actually enforce things so yeah you haven't issued patent but then to enforce it's going to be tens if not millions hundreds or typically millions of dollars to enforce patent rights and so yeah maybe you get your patent issued and you get issued quickly but it's difficult to enforce it because you don't really have the bankroll to do that so like i said so for uh for for smaller companies for early stage companies you know who are inventors entrepreneurs and startups almost by default i'll file that provisional patent application and then um you know file the non-provisional a year later starting with the non-provisional patent application that tends to be the strategy of larger company companies so you know larger companies um you know who have hundreds of assets you know a thousand assets they tend to file non-provisional patent applications first okay so what is the anatomy of a utility patent application so okay we have the drawings we have what's called a specification and then we have a session called the claims and when people are looking to determine whether there's infringement or what is covered by a patent they'll look at the drawings they'll look at the description or the specification and they'll assume that everything there is protected but that's not really true the claims section which is these little weird sections these little weird sentences at the very end of the patent application or the issued patent it's it's these weird claims sections that actually define the meats and bounds of what is actually protected and here's a venn diagram to kind of give you a sense of you know what is actually protected in in patent applications and the way to think about it so you have the big circle and that's the specification and drawings and in a subset of that is actually the claim so what's important here is that everything in the specific specification in drawings typically is not actually protected the claims will typically cover what is a subset of the whole application so the mistake that people make is they look at the drawings and say oh well you know all this stuff in the drawings this is actually covered or read the whole description say okay well everything in this description this is covered by the patent that is untrue you have to look at the claims at the end of the of the issued patent in order to understand what is actually protect protected now that is not always easy to do okay so the claims really influence two things one is going to be infringement so it's important to understand what the difference is between infringement and patentability okay so infringement is all about the claims of an issued and enforceable patent so a patent application that publishes a published patent application will have claims in it but those claims are not enforceable yet because the application is still pending and a lot of times like i said earlier a patent application accomplished it can go abandoned so you may come up come and find a publication and the application may already be abandoned okay the big mistake that people make is they look at the claims of a pending application and are scared off by those things when that patent application is uh is actually already abandoned and those claims were never enforceable and aren't currently enforceable so again infringement relates to issued and enforceable patents and the question with infringement is does the accused product have all the elements as defined in at least one claim of the of the issued patent we're going to kind of go into that analysis in a bit patentability is very different so when it comes to your product the question of is that product patentable that's a question of prior art so are the patent claims in your patent application are they new and non-obvious compared to prior we kind of talked about that earlier so that's the big difference between patentability and infringement people say well you know oh well you know my patent application it infringes somebody else's patent well that's not really true yours your application may not be patentable in view of somebody else's prior which could be an issued patent it could be a pending patent application but that's not infringement so a patent application cannot be infringing just because you have a patent application someone cannot sue you for infringement for having a patent application that may cover some of the things in their issued patent and a lot of times the vast majority of what is in in patent application in the description and drawings that's going to be prior art that's going to be things that is well known it's going to be background stuff technology so patentability is it relates to the claims of your patent application whether those are new and non-obvious over the prior art so we i i've been using the term prior art a lot and i've kind of talked about this a bit but it's it's important to understand what is considered private so it's anything that is a technology disclosure before you file your patent application and so i said in in the examination process a lot of times this is going to be issued patents which which are published patent publication of pending patent applications that's i would say 95 time that's the prior you're going to see in the examination process because that's the easiest stuff to to look up those sort of technology disclosures have the most description and that's why patent examiners tend to use that a lot more but really any technology disclosure is eligible as priority i mean this can be like scientific papers articles whether it be in say in a newspaper or online it can be books videos talks actual products product catalogs so anything that disclose technology can be used as prior against a patent application okay so let's kind of go over the examination process we already kind of talked about the basics of it but i'll kind of get into the some of the nitty gritty here so like i said before you file your non-provisional patent application at the uspto it waits in line for one to three years and again keep in mind that it's all about the claims the claims define what the meats and bounds of the protection are or or are going to be so you've already seen this graphic and it's sort of a good way to understand what's going on in the patent examination process you have the specific specification and drawings which are going to discuss a bunch of stuff and the claims are only going to be describing a subset of that like i said specification drives they can include prior art things that are well known things that you know totally aren't patentable that's totally fine a lot of times you can have multiple inventions in one application and the claims are only going to be covering one of those inventions in any given application so like like you can see here claims are typically a subset of the whole uh specification drawings so file the application uh the pat the patent examiner does a prior search and determines you know whether what the claims are new and non-obvious and let's say the examiner comes up with some prior art here's what happens the example the examiner issues what's called an office action which defines the rejections um of the you know that are the results of his uh his or her prior art search so i'm going to give you the example here of an obviousness rejection and a novelty rejection so the red circle um the examiner is saying okay well this portion of the claims the sort of the claim the the prior art it covers those portions of those claims so those claims or those portions those are not those those aren't novel over the prior art now sort of the yellow section that's going to be analogous to what is an obvious rejection so with those claims the examiner's saying okay so i wasn't able to find one piece of pride that talked about everything that's in these claims instead i found prior one and piece of prior number two and combine those elements and if you combine those two that covers certain claims so that's what a obviousness rejection is going to be okay so you have these rejection oh my gosh well do you just give up no you don't i mean rejections are a natural part of the patent examination process and i would say 98 of time you're gonna have rejections like i said think of the examination process like a negotiation just like a like for instance like think about pawn stars or american pickers um it wouldn't be a very good show and it wouldn't be very good negotiations if they said hey um you know i want to sell you this for x and there's no haggling over that right so just like haggling over buying something from somebody or selling something to somebody the the patent examination process is like a negotiation the claims are kind of the same way so okay how do you get over these rejections one thing you can do is you can argue against the exam say well examiner you didn't understand the prior correctly it doesn't actually cover the claims in the way that you are saying they do or you didn't understand the claims the claims actually are different than the prior art as as you're interpreting it alternatively what you can do is you could amend the claims so the claims they have to be amended within the scope of the description and drawing so for instance let's let's kind of go to the next slide so for instance let's say you amend the claims to add new elements now it's here's some important things to note here so i'll kind of flip between these two slides and kind of you know kind of give you a sense of what's going on so you've expanded the scope of these claims and effectively what that is you're going to be adding new language what's important to note is that okay you've added it to you know include things that aren't in the the combination of prior number one and number two things that aren't in prior number one alone but what you add in there has to be within the scope of the specification and drawings if not it's going to be considered new matter and those amendments are going to be rejected so that's kind of an important thing to note here is that and and that's why the claims tend to be um you know just a subset of what is in the description that allows you to amend the claims and add things you can't add things that aren't already in there so what you've done here in in this example is you've amended the claims and so those little pieces that are the new you know the new parts of the claims that um aren't in the prior the examiner would say oh okay you've added something it's not in this one single piece of prior it's not in pieces of prior number one or number two and so then the examiner can say okay then the application is allowed so this is kind of the scope of what the allowed uh patent application would be and the the and the scope of the claims and the specification and so kind of look at the beginning so you have these claims that are that that you know that are that have less in them and then by the end of examination the claims have more description in in them and that was done to get over the prior and get the application allowed an issue fee is then paid and then the application issues as a patent okay now i want to give you some examples of how to understand claims and that less is more with claims so take a second to look at these three different claims okay so you have claim a you've claimed b and claim c okay so i'll give you a kind of second to take a look at these okay so which one do you think is going to be a better claim if you could choose one which claim would you choose would you like a would you like b or would you or would you like c the the secret here is is that less is more when it comes to patent claims claim a is actually the best one because it has the has the least number of elements so the standard for infringement is is whether the accused product has all the elements defined in one claim so for instance in claim a you only have three elements and it's a lot more easy to infringe because it doesn't take as many things in a potential competitor product for there to be infringing compared to claim c which has a lot of specific things that may seem like it's good but that's actually harder to infringe okay now let me kind of give you some examples uh very specifically so okay so let's say we say we have claim a and then you have these five competitor products let's say this is the claim that you have in your in your product so to do an analysis of infringement here you compare all the elements in this claim to these products so let's start up with the claim analysis split them into their constituent parks parts so let's just arbitrarily say there's three uh claim elements here so a vehicle comprising so okay i mean all these are vehicles right i mean these are all you know bicycles quad sickles tricycle uh you know single wheel um so they're all vehicles okay so the next element is a frame okay so well you know a has a frame and yeah it's a single frame and there is clear clearly have frames as well now the next element is one or more wheels coupled to the frame okay so here let's see so even with the even with the unicycle yeah that has you know one or more wheels that has one wheel coupled to the frame and the other ones those clearly have you know you know a wheel couple to frame so all of those are giving me infringing claim a right remember so claim a was this broadest one let's look at claim c we can skip over b because you know it's never the middle of road one right so uh so claim c let's kind of look at look at this one so let's let's say then in this one we have one two three four five elements in this one starting off with a vehicle comprising a frame we already kind of went already already went over this one so yeah all of these are going to have a frame right then let's look at the new element here a rotatable pedal pedal assembly coupled to the frame and including a chain okay so suddenly this is where it gets interesting all right so if you look at a if you look at the unicycle well there's not a chain in that one right it's coupled directly to the axle so a isn't going to infringe and same with b right you know it has the pedal directly to the axle so those aren't going to be infringing in c d and e um in d and e you can see the the chain in there and in c you can see where there's gonna be a chain guard so there's gonna be a chain in that one so here just because that one element not being present in a and b a and b don't infringe okay now let's look at the next element a seat coupled to the frame okay well let's see so only c d and e are left c has a c coupled to the frame right you know you can kind of you can kind of see that d has that e has that okay so c d and e they're still all candidates for being infringing let's move on to the next element then a handlebar assembly coupled to the frame okay c's got a handlebar d's got a handball he's got a handlebar okay so c d and e are still already in it now the next one is less than three wheels coupled to the frame okay well so that kind of caused a problem for uh d and e uh d has three wheels so that's not less than three e has four wheels and that's not less than than three so here claim c only the the bicycle with two wheels actually is going to infringe that and that's the big difference between broad claim a versus narrow claim c it makes the difference between all of these things infringing to only one infringing so in a patent application then why wouldn't you just go in with the broadest claim um you know and and go with that well that's a good way to start the examination process but a lot of times the examiner is going to come up with prior art and you're going to have to add more elements and maybe you know let's say you start off with a and maybe you get to claim c which you know doesn't infringe all of those or maybe get to c where it doesn't infringe that many that's the examination process that's the negotiation it depends on the prior art and that's what's going to determine whether you have a broad coverage of patent protection or whether you have a narrow coverage of patent protection that's that's about it let me kind of summarize the takeaways here so the first one is file before you make public disclosures public uses or offers for sale or before talking with inventors like i said patent rights start to be lost upon a upon first public disclosure public user offer for sale and it's good to file before you talk to inventors even though patent rights don't typically start to be lost when you start talking with investors it's a good way to be able to talk with folks without having them sign ndas which they're not going to want to do and it's going to be insulating them to them anyway and being able to improve your pitch by saying things are patent pending also inventors must affirmatively sign their patent rights to the company just being an employee just being a contractor does not mean those folks have an automatic obligation to assign their patent rights to the company there has to be a specific clause in contracts that say these folks are required to and better yet say i hereby already assign my rights to any inventions that i may come up with that is an important thing for contracts that you may be drafting with employees collaborators other folks that you're working with and also patent claims can be broad or narrow and that's kind of what we went over in the example of those patent claims a b and c the wording of the claims can define whether you have a broad patent that covers a lot of different variations you know like the broad claim a that covered all those five versions or maybe you have a narrow claim c that only covers one version patents are not a binary thing where just you have a patent or you don't it's a it's sort of a you know can have a you know a a gradient or a a different scope of protection that's important understand when it comes to patents okay and then also infringement and patentability are different again infringement relates to whether the accused product reads on all elements of at least one claim of an issued and enforceable patent patentability is a question of so for a pending patent application that you file and this is going to be the non-provisional patent application are the claims new and non-obvious over the prior art also examination is like a negotiation that's an important thing to understand that you know there are going to be rejections and if anything that's a good part of negotiation just like like i said you know with shows like uh pawn stars or american pickers the reason why you start off with a low offer for instance when you're trying to buy a product is because you know there's going to be some negotiation and that's how you sort of work your way to a middle ground with folks hey an easy way to buy something is you know offer double what it's worth anybody's going to accept that offer an analogy here would be is for instance you know going with claims that are so narrow that you know the examiner is never going to be able to find any prior that's going to be able to cover that sure you're going to be able to get your your your patent through um but you're going to end up with claims that are so narrow that it probably isn't going to cover the product that you have and no competitor product is ever going to be able to infringe it because it's so narrow okay so that's why the negotiation of examination is so important also be sure to talk with the with the patent attorney early like i said a lot of patent attorneys are going to be able to do a free assessment it can only take a half an hour to an hour and that's a really easy way to sort of spot a lot of these issues early on and to you know make sure that you're not actually forfeiting rights and to kind of plan out protection and kind of have a sense of when these costs are coming up a lot of times it makes sense to wait as long as you can before making public closures public user offers for sale and a patent trainer is going to be able to kind of help you plan those things and let you know kind of when the timing is going to be and the cost of stuff so that's about it um love to hear your comments down below let me know if you have any questions if any of this didn't make sense if it raised any issues for you if you've gone through the patent examining process you'd love to hear about that and also be sure to subscribe for more great content on patents and and startups again my videos typically are a lot shorter than this one this one is a long one a long form video because this is the talk that i'm giving for the king county bar association here in seattle so yeah thanks for watching and we'll see you again in the next video",

        "transcript": "What I want to talk to you about is the future of artificial intelligence and kind of my perspective of kind of where I see things going, how you can keep up with artificial intelligence. As you can see, it's progressing really, really fast and it'll probably continue to progress even faster. And I want to give you a framework to sort of conceptualize how to understand AI and how to understand uh learning with AI. And so to give you a bit of my background uh in addition to the sort of the great introduction, thank you so much. Um, I'm Dylan Adams. I'm a partner and patent attorney at the firm of Davis Wright Tmaine. We're one of those really big law firms. We have over 650 attorneys in offices all up and down the West Coast, uh, on the East Coast as well. My practice is in patent prosecution, which sounds like litigation. and I do a bit of litigation, but patent prosecution is a sort of the technical term for planning patent portfolios, planning protection for inventions, drafting and filing patent applications, and then working those patent applications through the examination process at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. And so to work with my clients especially, I need to understand the technology as well, if not better than them. So I have a a technical background including masters in electro engineering undergrad in biochemistry and microbiology and I work with clients of all types whether they be startups shark tank companies fortune 100 companies um and a huge variety of technology although I'd say the core of what I tend to do is related to computers AI robotics uh software things like that but really it runs the gambit um but what I really enjoy doing is working with startups and and even larger companies who are new to in new to intellectual property, new to patents and helping them build uh bespoke uh patent uh portfolios. So the way the patent process works is we have an idea and then we are going to then decide to draft and file this patent application and these are really highly technical documents. A lot of times they're going to be 40, 50, 100 pages of technical description and drawings. We file that in the United States Patent Trademark Office and then it waits in line for 1 to 3 years. The reason why is it's the government. they're just really behind on everything and it takes one to three years before your application gets up to the top uh of the pile. It starts a negotiation with the examiner then where what we're trying to do is get the broadest patent scope possible and then the examiner has to make sure that what you have claimed is new and non-obvious over the prior art. This negotiation like any negotiation there's going to be rejections. That's a natural part of it. You go back and forth with examiner. Sometimes it can be months, sometimes it can be years. Hopefully the application is allowed at some point. You pay an issue fee and then the application then issues as a patent. So, one of the interesting things about patents is that by default things are going to be held in secret for at least 18 months and potentially up until the application grants as a patent. So, I'm seeing a lot of things, especially my practice related to AI and robotics and software that isn't going to be coming out for several years. It's in development or maybe the back end of systems um that are being used, but really people don't necessarily know how that's being used. So, that's kind of my perspective of where, you know, I kind of see AI. Um, and and and I kind of want to give you a sense of where where are we going? Where are we now? And so, does anybody know what this is? Anybody? Yes. Close. Yes. I I think I heard somebody. It's the Apple 2e computer, right? Came out in January of 1983. And for all the computer nerds out there, it had 64K of RAM, right? So I I want to impress upon you that with artificial intelligence, we are at this stage right now with artificial intelligence. We are just at the very beginning and just as much as computers and the internet completely transform the world and business and we're going to be seeing those things with artificial intelligence as well. So strap in, get ready because we're going to see the same sort of transformation and there's a lot of things that will be happening that we are going to have a hard time even understanding, you know, what's going to be happening just as much as you can you see back in the day back in 1983 when the Apple 2e came out. So what are some things that I'm seeing with uh artificial intelligence? Obviously, it's going to get a lot smarter. A lot of companies what they're working towards is artificial general intelligence or AGI. You may have heard that term. That's what a lot of these companies are focused on. So AI is going to become smarter. Also new uses and Ellen touched on this which was really great is that right now we have sort of a base. We have these LLMs. We have generative AI but we still have to do a lot of work with it and people are incorporating that into a lot of new applications into new software applications. So it's actually getting out to users in in new forms in new software apps things like that. We're going to see that expand a lot and intelligence and artificial intelligence is going to become more ubiquitous just as much as we see computing devices around us all the time. We're going to see embedded intelligence in a lot of common things. Artificial intelligence being able to interact with these things. That's going to become a lot more common. Also, as Ellen mentioned, AI agents is going to be a big thing. And right now, if for those of you who use LLMs, it's sort of a back and forth, right? You have to put in a prompt, you get a response, you put another prompt, you get a response. Agents or agentic AI as as it's called, it's going to allow more autonomous action by this uh artificial intelligence. So you can give it task and maybe it'll think about it for a minute or two, maybe 10 minutes, or maybe it'll actually go off and do things. It can actually accomplish things in the real world. It can talk with other AI agents. It can talk with people, say maybe via email, via text, things like that. Sometimes maybe it'll even take days. It'll it'll be a long-term project that I'll be working on and maybe it'll kind of pass back to you. Say, \"Hey, I have a question about this or I had a follow-up so and so their schedule is busy.\" Things like that. It's going to be more interactive. Think about when you work with people via email and you never see them. AI agents are going to be similar to that. Okay. So, how do you navigate this world of artificial intelligence when it's changing so much? Um, and I want to kind of get the temperature of folks here and ask you some questions. So, who feels like really comfortable with artificial intelligence? Anybody feel feel like they're a pro user? They're really good at it. Nice. Okay, good. And who feels really good about incorporating it into your business or into your personal life? Anybody? Anybody? Good. Excellent. Okay. And then how about anybody just feel really good about not being replaced by AI or being uh you know you know having AI kind of replace your job or make you irrelevant? Anybody feel totally confident that that's not going to happen? Good. Excellent. Okay. So, let me ask you another question then. How many have you how many of you have used an LLM before? And this is the example of DeepSeek. Um, good. So, almost everybody's used an LM. That's that's excellent. Okay. Who would say that they use an LM maybe on a at least once a month? Okay. And then so of of those people who was using it probably at least once a week. At least once a week using LMS. Great. Okay. How about at least once a day? Okay. And then of using it once a day. Who's using it? Probably like at least once an hour on average, especially during the business day. At least once an hour. Nobody's using it at least once an hour. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Okay. Here's what I want to impress upon you is that you don't need to be worried about being replaced by AI. You need to be worried about being replaced by the people who are using LLMs and other AI on a regular basis. Like the folks who had their hands up who said they're using on a daily basis, those are the people you need to be concerned about about replacing you. It's not AI that that that that's to be concerned about. It's the people who who know how to use artificial intelligence. Okay. So, let me ask you another quick question here. So, you got Google Translate. How do you get to the main menu on Google Translate? Anybody? How do you get get to the menu? Throw out a guess. Google Translate. Translate. Yeah. Okay. Well, so so to get to the main menu, what you do is there's the the the little bars over there. You click on that. A little menu pops up, right? And to a lot of people like that's kind of intuitive. You'd be able to hack around. You'd be able to find that. But being able to do that, you're building on a lot of information that you know about graphic user interfaces, about computers, things like that. And as a result, you you you see it as intuitive, but there's a lot of stuff going on that you've built knowledge on that got you there. Okay. So, I like to use the analogy with my practice. So what allows me to understand new technology that's coming out that is cutting edge that has never been seen before or new areas of technology that I'm not immediately familiar with. I have to understand the language of science of computers of math of of engineering. I have to understand those languages so I can adapt and understand new things that come out. And what I want to challenge you to do is learn the language of artificial intelligence. And by that I mean become comfortable with it. Just like you'd be able to figure out how to find the menu on Google Translate because you've done those things, right? You those things are seemingly intuitive, you need to make artificial intelligence part of your daily routine so that you can then build on that as things change and things grow. And it's it's fairly simple. I want to give you some basic steps here. It's again, it's it's working through these things every single day, taking baby steps, and and it's it's it's something that you just need to make part of your your natural routine. If you don't do that, you're going to have to be like this guy, and you're going to have to catch up really really quickly. Instead of taking baby steps, you're going to have to catch up super fast, and you're going to have to like, you know, leap up, you know, a whole, you know, a whole flight of stairs instead of taking small steps. And I'm sure you've seen people like this who they didn't really learn computers and they didn't learn how to use the internet and then they're kind of left behind. You don't want to be that person because a lot of those people, they're never going to be able to keep up. Okay. So, what do you do? Here's a good place to start. So, for those of you who who aren't using uh LLMs on a regular basis, start with something like this. These are some great examples. Um, and the the good thing about uh artificial intelligence like this is it's free. It's not like computers back in the day where you'd have to invest in expensive hardware. All these things are completely free. And for me, I don't have any paid subscriptions yet. I I use all free stuff and so there's no excuse to say, \"Well, I can't afford it.\" You can learn about artificial intelligence and incorporate it into your your daily workflow totally for free. Okay. So, what what can you do? I mean, the first thing is just experiment with it. Try it out. Try using it in your in your workflow. Experiment with say, \"Hey, you know what? if I wanted to do this analysis documents or you know you you only you can know about your work and how to adapt LMS to it but once you kind of get that basics is then think about prompting prompting is the new language of interacting with uh with artificial intelligence so it used to be web searches like the people who could do really good Google searches or who could search through documents those people were the power users of say the internet and the people who are really effective prompting is the way that you are going to become the power user of of artificial intelligence and Ellen really talked about this well that a lot of times it's human error people say oh you know AI doesn't work really well and people you know just like people say oh the computers don't work really well usually it's human error prompting is as much of an art as it is a science and the only way you're going to get good at is by trying it out every day working you know working with these things I I still feel like I'm way behind on prompting even though I do it all the time and I probably would say I'm probably you know use it on an hourly bas basis to do various things. Also try new uses as well. You know, people think about, oh, you know, generative AI can create pictures or it can write poems, but those are not the things that you're going to be using it for in your daily workflow or in your personal life. Experiment with new uses. And the more you use it, you're going to realize, hey, there there's a lot of interesting creative things that I can do that can make me more efficient both personally and and with my job. Also, try out new features that come out with uh with artificial intelligence. Again, Ellen touched on this things like the the deep the deep learning or the or the deep research where the LM will actually sort of think it's going to iteratively go back say hey here's what the user is asking here's how I want to actually address this maybe I'll go and I'll do some research along with that is sort of the the web search version uh perplexity and now chat GPT has a a web search version play around with those things again you just need to understand these things that are coming out now so that when things inherently change at a rapid pace you'll understand the baseline of things and you can build on that scaffolding and uh and understand new AI as it comes out. So that's my time. Um thank you and uh look forward to your questions for the for the rest session. Thanks.",

        "transcript": "[Music] okay my name is steven key and i think my story is a lot like a lot of people that are listening to this video when i was a little bit younger or quite a bit younger i realized i really didn't want to work for for anybody and i wanted to be creative and i wanted to kind of design my own life i knew deep down that working for somebody else wasn't really going to be something i was going to be happy with and i wanted to do something that i would wake up every day and just be excited i wanted to make things with my hands even i wanted to be creative and i wanted to kind of control my own destiny but like a lot of a lot of people that are listening to this i didn't really have any skills like i wasn't an engineer and i really didn't have any business experience and um but i did know that i wanted to be creative and i don't think i was that great you know making things either i did study art a little bit and i knew the pleasure of making something with your hands my dad gave me great advice he said if he finds something you truly love to do there's a good chance you'll never work a day in your life and he was he was absolutely right he he also told me to create great wealth you need to find something that doesn't require your hands or your presence and has a multiplying effect and i didn't really know what that meant until much much later when i was working at a toy company called worlds of wonder and i was over in china helping with the manufacturing of teddy ruxpin and i was on that production line and i was over there for months at a time and it was getting i was getting tired and i wanted to go home and i kept on thinking what am i doing wrong here and i remember that my father had told me that those lessons of creating great wealth and it dawned on me that the creator of teddy ruxpin can foresee he wasn't there and he definitely wasn't using his two hands and he had that multiplying effect because all those titties were coming off the production line and it kind of went i had this aha moment i realized that's what i wanted to do you see ken had licensed his technology teddy ruxpin to worlds of wonder and he was collecting royalties on every teddy they sold regardless of where he was living and that's the lifestyle that i wanted i learned about licensing on the production line in china and when i finally got back to the states i quit world's wonder and i decided i wanted to create my own products my own inventions and i wanted to show those ideas to companies and i just knew deep down if i showed a company a great idea they would probably take it from me and pay me i wasn't fearful i just knew that companies need ideas and at the time two of the industries that were actively looking for ideas from the outside was the toy industry they were working with outside toy inventors for years and years and years and also the novelty gift industry was always always looking for ideas as well so i started creating ideas and sending those ideas to those companies and very quickly i was able to license ideas and they brought him to market for me and i was hooked i was so excited about seeing my ideas on the store shelves i was so excited about seeing an idea that came out of here and next thing you know it's on tv or you see it down at the local toy stores such as toys r us i was hooked the very first item that had licensed was an airplane i had teamed up with someone i met at worlds of wonder russell hicks and he was doing all the illustrations for the teddy ruxpin books and he hadn't i had this idea of these puppets and i wanted to do an airplane and a rocket and some other type of flying vehicles and i showed it to russell and he drew these up and i sent them over to this company called applause and they licensed those puppets from us and that was actually the very first thing i licensed so i kept on doing these drawings and sending them over to applause and they were licensing a lot of ideas i think probably over 20 at least and i was hooked at that time i thought it was fairly easy i also started to design a few things in the toy industry and one of them was called the michael jordan wall ball i didn't call i didn't call it the wall ball at the time but i love to play these indoor nerf basketball in my office just trying to come up with ideas but i didn't like the backboard because it was square and had this little image of michael jordan and it was just horrible so i took a poster of michael jordan put it on the backboard and i sent it off to ohio art and within three days i had a licensing agreement and the mic they called it the michael jordan wall ball which was a great great name and it sold for over 10 years and there's even a commercial on saturday mornings that i just love to watch go one-on-one with michael jordan right in your own room with michael jordan wall ball best looking back board i ever seen michael jordan wall ball from ohio art sports but i was kind of surprised how easy it was to license ideas to companies i didn't spend a lot of money on prototypes i didn't file intellectual property in fact i didn't really know what a patent was at the time and i didn't really build expensive prototypes i showed companies concepts and i knew deep down that it was really a numbers game that if i could test the market really quickly with the drawing the sketch or sell sheet and see if there's interest that was probably the smart thing to do i knew that if i if i was if i wanted to be successful at this and i wanted to do this full-time and i wanted to make a living licensing my ideas i had to come up with a system that allowed me to test my ideas very very quickly and it worked i came up with a 10-step system that i used throughout my whole career and then i started to share that knowledge with other people and one of the biggest ideas i licensed using that 10-step system was a rotating label that basically just delivered 75 percent more space on a container you see there's never enough space and i read this article in the modesto b and i came up with this concept and i started to show it to companies and soon enough i ended up on tv and licensed it to ccl label and we sold hundreds of millions of labels sundown herbals presents its remarkable twist and learn label it works like an herbal information center that helps you learn about herbs simply by turning the label sundown's new twist and learn label where to turn for help one day i met my partner andrew krauss by accident he was running a very large inventors group in silicon valley and i went there on a saturday morning and met him and i brought some of the things that i had licensed to his meeting and i just showed him the people and everybody was really surprised and and andrew knew something was up because he was teaching inventors how to commercialize their inventions but most of the inventors were not having a lot of success so here i show up and i i pull out all these things i had licensed and i had a crowd around me and andrew knew i was doing something very different and he knew that knowledge was probably going to be very very helpful to a lot of inventors so now i i've teamed up with andrew krauss we started this company called invent right and i started oh just talking about this process of licensing and soon enough we had a lot of people that were following us and they were taking my course and then one day the phone rang and it was someone from mcgraw-hill the san francisco office and they said steve why don't you write a book i thought why would i want to write a book he said well you're doing something very different it looks like you're having a lot of success you have a lot of people that are following your 10 steps so why don't you write a book and sure enough i did and it became fairly popular it actually surprised me it was back in 2011 and we called it one simple idea i didn't really think at the time that anybody would really care i really didn't know anything about writing a book so i just did it i told my story and that story resonated with a lot of people you see there's a lot of people like myself that just don't want to start businesses and there's a lot of people that just don't want to quit their day job and they want to be creative and they want to share that creativity with the world so when i told my story about what i wanted to do there was a lot of other people that connected with my story and i the truth it surprised me and and uh it was probably one of the greatest things i've ever done i remember when i got that call from mcgraw-hill and what did i what did i know about writing a book so i called a good friend of mine at the time tim ferriss i he was one of my students early on when andrew and i were teaching these 10 steps and he had written a book called the four hour work week and that book just became huge and it was a best seller in fact i think it's a bestseller even today and when i was asked to write this book the first thing i did was reach out to tim and i said tim um mcgraw-hill wants me to write a book what should i do and he said steve if you do decide to write a book realize one thing whatever you do make sure you give everything away don't hold back write this book like it's the last book you'll ever write that was the best advice i could have ever received from anyone because i didn't hold back i wrote everything i knew about the 10 steps that i have been using i poured it out i did not hold anything back so tim i could not thank you enough for giving me that great advice i remember when the book came out in 2011 i was a little nervous i what did i know about writing a book and i didn't think it would sell i don't think anybody would ever read it or even find it but sure enough we sold a lot of books and it's people started talking about it and they started sharing the book and before you know it we started seeing all these people embrace these 10 steps and they started to follow me and they started to write me notes and before you know it uh one simple idea has been lice has been translated in i think five different languages and the sales of the books just kept on coming in and the reviews kept on coming in and people really liked the book now i have to tell you it it lays out my 10 steps in the process that i've used in a very simple story format but that story really connected with a lot of people book sales started to come in and mcgraw-hill was pretty happy about it and i got this call they said steve come on out we want you to do a little uh pr there's a couple tv stations that would like to have you on i thought well this is going to be really fun but i i knew a little bit about being on national tv just a little bit but i was excited about it and soon enough janice and i flew out to new york and we did a couple of spots on national tv here to tell us how to become no risk entrepreneurs through licensing concepts to companies we're joined by stephen key he's the author of the book one simple idea our guest has tips to help turn your inventions into a licensing gold mine stephen key is the co-founder of invent right and has successfully licensed more than 20 simple ideas soon i was traveling around the country to a lot of groups a lot of the clubs and venting clubs across the country i'm speaking at universities people were asking me to talk about the book bring some books sign some books so i started traveling around and just had a wonderful experience meeting people that had read one simple idea companies all over the world have realized that they need to open their doors for them to truly be competitive today it's all about innovation it's all about new products so open innovation is so exciting and it's exploding when i first started out it was just in a couple different industries but now it's in every industry i've seen products get licensed and the toy industry pet drtv automotive health beauty fitness you name it it's in all these different industries now that companies need ideas from us and the reason why to stay competitive today you have to keep on coming up with new ideas so they've opened their doors to to look at ideas from us so this these 10 steps that i have in the book kind of outline what you need to do to reach out to these companies these companies that have opened their doors and want to work with us inventors now today the reason why i'm doing this short little video we're celebrating 10 years it's been 10 years since i wrote one simple idea and we have over 800 five star reviews on amazon little did i know that this little this little yellow book would touch so many people's hearts and i have to tell each and every one of you that's watching this video thank you very much for commenting thank you very much for purchasing one simple idea but thank you very much for following the 10 steps and and not just sitting on the couch not just spending money on prototypes or filing patents not just letting your dreams die i'm glad that you picked up the book i'm glad that you're doing something with those ideas because the road map is all laid out in this book of how you can license or rent those ideas to companies that are looking for ideas i just want to thank each and every one of you for reading one simple idea and please keep on sending me your photographs and sharing your stories with me i'd love to hear from you this is stephen key thank you very much there's a great idea in each of us but it's truly magical to see it come to life sharing your creativity with the world has never been easier we can help you",

        "transcript": "All right, Stephen Key here and >> Dana Nolles. >> If you want to know how to get your product into companies and you want to work with the best in the world, watch this video. [Music] Okay, Stephen Key here, Dana Nolles. Hey, this is the Mitright TV and I have a very, very, very special person with me today. Dana, how are you? >> I'm great. I'm wonderful. I'm actually here live in Stephen Keyy's office. That's right. This is great. >> Okay. Um, what are we gonna talk about? >> I I asked you that about 10 minutes ago and he said he's going to surprise me. >> Yes. We're going to talk about getting your getting your product into companies. We're going to talk about a little bit about why is it so hard to get your product to companies today? And Dana, it's gotten harder. And I know you're listening and you've got this great product idea and you want to get it to a company, but for some reason they're ghosting you and they're not letting you in. So Dana, just so you know, she runs one of our programs at InventRight called Gateway. She's the gateway queen. >> Where's my tiara? My tiara. >> And she calls companies along with the rest of the team, rest of the Gators. I think they call themselves the Gators. >> And they call companies every single day. And I think you've gotten in how many companies now? >> Uh well over 800. I usually do a count about every 30 days. So I don't maybe we're at 820 8:30 at this point. >> Okay. Now what does that mean getting in? Does that mean you've reached out to an email or you actually talked to somebody? >> Okay. That means that we have either called the company, emailed the company, LinkedIn, messaged the company or someone in that company. We have found the person, not a customer service person, not a support at whatever email that we've talked to someone. We've talked to this the person in the company that actually will receive the email, we'll receive the cell sheet, the marketing material, and they either are the decision maker or they are on the team of decision makers. That's what mean That's what getting in means. >> That's what getting in means. Okay. You've got a great product idea and you're not quite sure what to do. Or maybe you've got inventory in your garage because you were selling your product on Amazon and you don't want to continuous doing it, but you want someone to help you license your idea to a company to bring it to market for you. We have a new program that's called Gateway where we do all the work for you. will find the right companies and the right people to make sure your product is pitched correctly to get the licensing deal. This new program is called Gateway. If you're interested, please check it out. So, let's talk about that. It's not easy to do. >> I think it is, but I've also been doing it for many, many, many years. Okay. >> And I've got a reputation. >> Okay. But getting in and finding the right person >> to to pitch an idea through the gateway program. People have ideas. They want us to get that their ideas in front of the right companies. >> But Dana, sometimes you got to call that company. A lot to get in. I mean, give us an idea of how long it takes sometimes to get to the right people. >> Well, I just had it happen where it was a year and a half before I found the right person. Big huge pet company. It was a year and a half. And I didn't I didn't work on it 40 hours a week, seven days a week, but it was periodically I would focus on reaching out to another 10 people, maybe making a couple more phone calls, sending out a couple more emails, sending out a couple more LinkedIn messages until I finally found someone that said, \"I'm the one that's like hitting the lottery.\" >> So Dana, >> get so stupid excited. >> Well, you know why you get excited? Because someone asked me the other day, >> you sound like you just got a deal, but you just got into a company, but it's gotten harder. >> Why is it harder? Is it because there's just a lot of noise? It's because why are there so many walls today to get the companies in your opinion? I I'm going to be real brutally honest because and I'm speaking from an inventor standpoint because inventors don't know what they're doing and they waste time reaching out to companies, the wrong companies saying all the wrong things and companies are really leery about that. Like I don't I they want to work with inventors. They must innovate. Companies must innovate. There's no doubt about it. But when it comes to working with inventors, the companies, I truly believe that they want to make sure that they're talking to and working with people who understand the product development and how the the industry in general and that's why we're so good at doing what we do is because from the jump what we're saying to them, they know that we know what we're talking about. >> Does it have to do also so their experience working with inventors has not been great at times? I get it. Sometimes they're seeing products that aren't a good fit. Maybe they're seeing product ideas that they don't even understand what it is. Maybe they're dealing with people that are just starting out. But everybody has start out somewhere, >> but because of that, they're a little bit cautious because they don't they're kind of afraid of us sometimes, aren't they? That we're going to do something stupid. >> They're going to waste their time. But also, I've realized sometimes they have dealt with us in such a way that they want to make sure we're not going to do something funny like try to sue them or for some reason. So, they're literally Okay. So, your job at at at the gateway program is to get into companies. So, once you get to the right person, the right fit, you make a list of companies, you got all these these people that want to see ideas. What do you send them? I send them the marketing material in a form of a sales sheet or a video. Maybe uh we're working on a client right now that the video sells the product. >> All right, >> we don't even need the cell sheet, but we may send the sales sheet over with the video embedded in it. You know, our our goal is to send that over to them. They have to get the idea quickly and then they can make a decision on one thing. They're gonna make a decision. Nope, we're not interested. Okay, that could happen. Hey, we're not interested. Great. Thank you so much for your time. Uh, you know, may I send you over more ideas in the future. Every time we ask that, the company says absolutely because we're sending over good marketing material. We're sending over products that are in their industry and we're accepting a no with grace and dignity. >> No, I want to argue about it. I want to say, wait a minute, wait, you got it wrong. I need to send you more information. >> Yeah, >> they probably don't like that. >> Companies hate that. No, I would ne I would never argue with a company for I don't even care, honestly. And I know we I'm going to you had talked about something the other day on Zoom and I'm just going to disagree with I'm disagreeing with Stevie Key. I would never go back and rebuttle a company >> because if I do I I'm going to shoot myself in the foot for the next person that comes >> with a with a product. Yeah. >> So, how long does it take when you submit it? Are you Do you get ghosted, too? >> Oh, yes. Oh, gosh. Yes. Do you get ghosted? >> No. Let me explain something. I've been pitching my idea since I was 18 years old. I don't pitch to them anymore. I give it to her. Okay. So, >> yes, we do get ghosted. Yes, we do. Um, that it just happened to me. It just happened to me the other last week I reached I I had a very good relationship with a company that came on to one of our bridging the gaps and we had pitched him a couple ideas and I know there the company's open and I know the guy's still working and I he wouldn't answer. He wouldn't answer me back. >> So, what do you do? What do you do? I'm going to tell you what I did. I called him because I had his cell phone number. Left a voicemail. I texted him because I had a cell phone number. I emailed him and I LinkedIn messaged him all within probably 10 minutes. Guess what? He got back in touch with me. >> Feels like you're stalking them >> a little bit. But I think Well, and I think it's, >> you know, you can professionally be a little persistent, but professional. And I really kind of switched it around a little bit like saying, \"Hey, I'm concerned about you.\" Like, \"Are you okay? I haven't heard back. It's unlike you that I haven't heard back.\" But this is also, keep in mind, I've had a relationship with this person at this company for probably about five years. So, this isn't somebody that I just met. >> Last question. How important is to have that relationship? >> Okay. Well, this I'm going to say it's extremely important to have that relationship but the problem is you have to start the relationship somewhere >> okay >> I never had when I joined invent right in 2017 I had five LinkedIn connection requests I mean five LinkedIn connections I don't even know who they were >> I had to build my reputation on LinkedIn so that these people at these companies wanted to work with me >> okay >> and Then I built relationships. First I started with relationships from other Inventrite members, the Inventrite staff, um anybody else that was kind of in product development just saying, \"Hey, I'm trying to expand my network. Love to connect, you know, and then and then build up a reputation.\" So companies, it's a lot easier for us to get in because we have those relationships. That's the whole point of what why we do what we do because we spent years and years and years to build these relationships. >> It sounds like this takes a long time. It can take a long time. But, you know, >> if I'm just starting out, you're telling me I've got to go on LinkedIn, make some connections, spend some time, build those relationships, make sure I I pitch the right product, I don't fight back, I find the right person. It's just time spent, isn't it? >> Yeah. Yeah. And I think my my want to license my product, because that's what it was all about in the beginning was licensing my product. I didn't I never in a million years thought I'd be working for Invent, right? That wasn't the plan at all. But I got really good at what I was doing and now here I am. And but I Everybody has to start somewhere. And it's the ones that the ones that won't succeed are the ones who just quit because this is not get rich quick. It's you can you can or succeed quick. Okay. >> This is succeed slow and steady. >> No. >> No. I want it now. I want it now. Yeah. >> Okay. All right, everybody. Thank you for watching this video with Dana. I'm so glad you're out here. >> I know. >> I I said that the last time. I know you're glad I'm out here. >> Dana Dana knows what she's doing.

        "transcript": "Okay, everybody, Stephen Key here at Invent TV. I'm going to talk about the four things you need to do to get a licensing deal today. [Music] Okay, number one, you need a new idea. You guys, it's so important to have a new idea because companies know all the products that are out there, but your idea needs to be new because sometimes when they see ideas, they're like, you know, I've already seen this before. So, don't let that happen to you. How do you do that? Do a Google shopping search. Do a Google image search. Maybe look around. Go down to some retailers. But your idea has to be new. It's very important. Don't come up with an idea that a company's already seen. So, make sure number one, your product is new. Do your homework. Number two, not only is your product new, it has a point of difference. It's better than products that are currently on the market today. It has to be because if they're going to take your product and put it on the store shelf compared to similar products out there, it has to have a point of difference that people actually want. Very, very important. Your point of difference has to be better than the products that are on the market today. Number three, know the cost. Everybody's a little hesitant. The economy is not great. So, make sure that you understand that your product can be manufactured at the same price of similar products or maybe even a little less. That can go a long way in today's world. So, number three, know your cost of the product so it has the right price point when it hits retail. Number four, be an asset. You guys, I have to tell you, most inventors kill deals. It's not their product isn't good enough. is that they don't know the language of licensing and they start to talk about things that drives these companies crazy. I've seen it firsthand. Don't be that person. I know you got a lot of questions, but you have to give these companies a little bit of credit that they know what they're doing. And don't drive them nuts. Don't be the reason why they don't pick up your product is because your lack of knowledge. Be an asset. All right, those are the four things you need to do to license a product today. Okay, you've got a great product idea and you're not quite sure what to do. Or maybe you've got inventory in your garage because you were selling your product on Amazon and you don't want to continuous doing it, but you want someone to help you license your idea to a company to bring it to market for you.

presentation through the panel a link to the recording from today will also be sent to you now I'd like to introduce today's presenters Jean Quinn Jean is the founder of IP watch.com a patent attorney law professor and leading commentator on patent law and innovation policy Jean was recently named one of the world's leading IP strategists by I am for the second consecutive year salvadore Bezos Salvador is a director in Stern Kessler's electronics practice group cell provides services in the preparation and prosecution of patent applications before the United States Patent and Trademark Office he develops enforceable patent portfolios capable of withstanding scrutiny in America Invents Act proceedings at the patent trial on appeal board Andy helped snap inventors navigate tricky post alles statutory subject matter issues in the business method and software spaces Sal is an adjunct professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School where he has taught a course on

Act jennifer is the immediate past president of the association of intellectual property firms she frequently speaks on intellectual property issues and is a source for a number of news articles regard intellectual property thank you again everyone for attending today's presentation and with that I will turn it over to Eugene thanks Kel and thank you all for joining us here today for the this conversation on patent drafting and thank you to Jennifer and Sal for joining me during our prep call on Friday for this we talked and talked and talked so I have no doubt that we're gonna have a very interesting conversation and we could probably talk all day about these issues so I'm looking forward to our conversation now this is the outline of what we hope to cover today and we we have plans to cover all of it but I suspect we're going to get a lot of questions and we'll take it wherever the webinar leads us but we'll pause here and I'm going to bring in Jen and Sal to give us their preliminary thoughts on in 2018 where are we with respect to drafting so we'll start with Jen and then Sal I'll ask you the same question before we start to go through the substantive slides that we've prepared what do you want the listeners to have in mind Jen I think one of the biggest things for me in drafting is Alice and it's IPR proofing and we're going to discuss both of these issues and so what I mean with respect to Alice's it's changed how we draft software applications in my years of practice we've gone through several different iterations and I think an important thing as a prosecutor is to understand that you have to change the way that you draft your patent application as the law changes and matures and you can't stick with a way that you learned 5 10 15 even 20 25 years ago and so in 2018 we're seeing new changes in the law new ways of doing things and we have to be amenable to changing our internal practice and not being set in our ways and then the second part of that is trying to IPR prove our patent applications and issued patents as much as possible and what I mean by that is what can we put into the specification what can we put into the claim to try to keep them from being invalidated in post-grant reviews and IPRs it's a tall task and as the patent owner it's gotten a little bit easier but it's still a tall task but there are tricks and things that we can do and I know Sal and I were just going back and forth during our protocol on it so we'll probably have more on that later yeah we haven't we have a slide for that and that was actually the part of the call that got the most animated and we were in violent agreement I think on all of that so looking forward to that so Sal your preliminary thoughts before we really kick off the substance what do you want people to know yeah you know I totally agree with everything that Jennifer just said I mean I think I would add and it's kind of on the bottom of the slide here is that practitioners are being asked to do a lot more with less often times and it's not necessarily something that in-house counsel would would want us to be in that position I think many understands the challenges with a you know Alice and IP are proofing patents on very limited budgets but we want to make sure that everyone's on the same page we understand where the value proposition is for the portfolio and that we are meeting the challenges as best we can with the tools we have head on and so I think definitely understanding the challenges of the key part of that but certainly being able to present them to to your clients in a way that will facilitate the the right business discussions around this is an important part of this as well yeah yeah and that's a part that I want to definitely get to and I came up during one of our previous webinars a couple weeks ago and we probably need to spend I think an entire webinar on that but we're going to touch it on that here today hopefully so let's just kick it off here and identifying the invention and improvement and most folks here on the webinar probably familiar with this but always like to have a slide here and not assume familiarity but increasingly over the last several years what we see in in the software space and and that that's where my experience is where a lot of Jennifer's experiences are in cell has a lot of familiarity with the software and electrical spaces and since really software is about 60% of applications now in one way shape or form this is a big deal and this is why we have to talk about changing our ways right right Jenny because over the last couple years things have changed rather dramatically they have it used to be that we would almost want to obfuscate the invention because we didn't want that to be the invention because then you were held to it and I think that it really has turned 180 degrees and that we want to be able to have somewhere in the spec that we can point to to say this is the invention examiner jury whatever the case may be and I was talking to the guys about this I work with a bunch of patent litigators and they're always looking for their theme in the trial what is the theme to the jury what is the creative aspect of this invention that makes it cool that this jury hey you should find infringement and no invalidity and that same concept of the same as much as I've pushed away from it as a prosecutor I'm starting to embrace it and putting it into my patent application but I want to be clear that I don't mean a single concept invention I hate it when we drop the patent application it's really only a single feature invention because if that features known then you're just out of luck for patentability but understanding what that problem is and what the solution to the problem is which is kind of the European aspect of the problem solution approach and I'm going to let Jean and Sal talk about this because I know they have a lot of interesting options on it too yeah and so one of the things that we talked about on Friday is about telling this story right you know I've been a fan and I've actually pushed back against this obstacle invention for a long time even when that was in vogue because I just I would read these applications and you get to the end and it's like well what was the invention don't really even understand what what the patent attorney thought was new I've always wanted to tell a story and I think you can do that in a positive way without comparing it against the prior art which is where you get into trouble right I mean I took John's point I you know I think that a lot of folks were sort of taking to heart cases that kind of showed the specific language in a patent application with detrimental and taking that at face value and minimizing the amount of content they were putting on their application and for awhile that worked but we can't really do that and really the challenge here is going to be how do we pick the right things to put into an application and you don't our call on Friday we talked about a background section for example you know a lot of people I will just do without a background section there's obviously a lot of case law around at prior art admissions and some of the detrimental effects of a background but and I'm not talking about you know a whole diatribe that goes on for pages and pages as a background but a one or two paragraphs background section that sets the stage and really tells sort of the contact and sets you up is going to make sense to so many different audiences and it's going to make all the difference when you get into your detailed description and really start talking about the innovative concepts in there you know going back to the problem solution approach that Jennifer was talking about we still teach that in our class and and if you're just talking about a solution without any context for what the problem is a lot of us is going to go sailing over people's head so yeah I think we do need to very carefully and this is this is why it's not an easy task anymore you know put the context and that's women to be needed to survive these IPR challenges to survive litigation yeah you know and I couldn't couldn't agree any more and because I do think that there's a role for the the background to set the table to explain things and you can do it in a way that doesn't I'll lay the trap for the future as long as you're you give some some thought to what it is that you're that you're doing because you don't want to get in a position especially now knowing post n fish all of these cases are what is the improvement does it improve something because if it doesn't improve something you're out of luck I even know that there were some practitioners that after n fish and this was before Burke himer gave some real real hope we're going back and adding a few no filing continuation is in part and they were adding language to distinguish the invention and explain why it was unique in in the application and then that they were being successful doing that and you know I I don't know that going back and doing that is what you what I want to encourage I think I would personally encourage doing it you know in the in the first instance now obviously there's good ways to do it there's bad ways to do it you don't want to say the only thing that's unique here like Jenin was saying but you got it I think explain the the invention and I just think we've kind of jumped the shark right if we are filing patent applications and are afraid to use the word invention then something is very seriously wrong I think but let's push to that next slide and this is just more of the invention improvement stuff from the crow that was also there just for your reference and and this we're not going to go through the KSR rationales and turn this into an obviousness lecture but whenever we talk about the background I think the the elephant in the room is KSR right Jen it is it is and with respect to 101 this has been the problem all along with Alice is it really a one of three analysis versus a 101 analysis but it does kind of come down and KSR and something I do with these KS are now why I think they're important to understand it's not really for the purpose of trying to defeat defeat an obvious mess rejection during during prosecution it's looking at them and understanding do you have a good idea of what the invention is and view of these KSR rationales can you go through each of them as the patent practitioner drafting that patent application and be able to explain and point to in your spec why combining the prior art elements isn't being done according to known methods I think it's a useful tool to almost use and reverse to establish that for both 101 purposes and then of course 103 purposes I agree because I think what we've what we don't what happened I think is once you see number 5 obvious to try and that's the big one from chaos alright because that clearly changed the law obvious to try was never a rationale to reject once obvious to try can become a rationale even though in ray kuben limited it then using the inventors own words against them it from the patent application becomes a rejection on steroids so you don't want to say anything that could in any way lead the examiner to believe that will what happened was the next logical step because it was the next logical step then it was expected and there's nothing nothing innovative so you can do such a good job describing the context that you talk your way out of a patent so if you do a really good job getting over 101 then you're walking over 103 and we can't have that but I think that fear Sal really is what led to a number of these patents post 2007 being I don't even know what the word is is I don't know that poorly written is the word but I think it was n wealth in but I think crafted in a way well maybe maybe there's two problems right there's the thin problem we talked about on well with respect to maybe people were doing this who weren't software savvy and then there's the people who were software savvy that were maybe trying to get too cute what do you think so yeah there's there's a little bit of each I mean I think really if you are describing an improvement that by way of just what's going on in an algorithmic form but you're not really tying it back to you know a specific performance improvement and you can convey that by way of example then you're going to run afoul of either 101 or 103 right there's some sort of link missing there and you know it's not a difficult one to it's not a difficult gap to bridge if you have that understanding of why somebody would actually perform these steps the the way that you've chosen to perform them by the way I was getting some feedback that I had an echo hopefully it's a bit better now I picked up the receiver but you know one of the things that that I I tried to do you know there's kind of a weird esoteric example and I'm not recommending anybody do this specifically but on a 101 case where you know there was a specific abstract idea that you know it was an economic financial method we took the purported abstract idea and put it into the preamble of a Jepson claim and and then put the balance of you know that improvement obviously in the structure of a Jepson claim into the body and and we're still fighting that but I mean it's an interesting way to kind of think about these issues again Jepson claims extremely limiting but you know I'm never gonna say don't do it but it's a good way to it's a it's a good thought exercise I think for a lot of these questions if you can describe the improvement in view of what adjustment claim preamble would look like then then you've got sort of what you need to focus on you know that's an interesting thing to think about because that certainly is something I think that you probably conceptually have to have to do and that's I think goes along gem with what you were saying about you know you got to think about the KSR rationales before you start drafting what's your what's your story to get past KSR but let's pause for a minute and think about that you know I think the patent industry has too many bright-line rules you know don't do this don't do this don't do this don't do this do this do this do this and if you go merrily along following all those I think a lot of times you can walk smack into the problem that you're trying to avoid gen it's awesome yeah I'm the city here not in my head 100% wholeheartedly agree because and I'll say this having practiced for quite a bit of years now you know with wisdom and maturity and age comes all that experience that I can now kind of sit back and go alright let's just use my common sense what's the best way to present this particular invention because it's such a fact intensive analysis for each invention each market each industry where the wall is in that particular period of time so if we do try to follow this set box of rules every single time I think we're kind of giving up using our experience and our common sense to help push these applications along because at the end of the day I preach this to people on my team the best thing you have for you is that common sense and which is kind of ironic that common sense is one of the obvious but I 100% agree we can't just always fit to our strictures that are in place at that particular time because someone told us that and that's a way supposed to be yeah now what what I will say is not knowing exactly who is on the on the other end listening to this if there's if there's younger attorneys or patent agents or folks earlier on in your career what I would say and Sal I want to get you to weigh in on this because I know you've been teaching law school classes more recently and than I have with respect to this what I would suggest is you got to know these bright-line rules and you in the beginning of your career probably want to be following more often than not and when you if you're less experienced you want to have an extremely good reason to violate one of these rules because they are there for a reason right Sal right well I mean to use the example I just gave a moment ago pretty much any textbook on the subject of claim drafting will probably just flat out tell you don't use a Jepsen claim and they'll tell you to do many to avoid many other things but when you have all of these tools available to you understanding the reason why you're being told not to do something as a general matter allows you to identify the exceptions and allows you to think creatively about what exactly are your clients needs in a given situation and oftentimes when we're presented with a whole new landscape you know when Alice was handed down when KSR was handed down and and all of the cases after that really clarify the bounds of their application it's it's important to know what's in your toolbox even if it's as a general matter not going to be used right I think that that's that's important is you have to have it in your toolbox and then maybe it will be appropriate at some point but I really like your suggestion about right at Jepson claim don't you don't have to file it but write it so that you can conceptually know what it is that you're trying to accomplish here and what it is that you're you know and understand to be in the prior art because one of the assuming one of the problems I think in a lot of these software cases is equal weight is given to describe things that are clearly not going to lead to the invention being considered patentable and you got to focus on what is what is new but we've kind of probably beat that horse to death so let's go I mean this is a I think you're gonna be an exciting slide here if this is the IPR proofing your patent I mean when you're this Jen it has to be in your mind when you're writing these things because if it's commercially valuable you are going to be IP art you are and IPR proofing it's not easy to do it takes time frankly I don't really concentrate on iar proofing my claims especially until I'm far into continuation practice which is usually when you the market starts to develop enough that you can actually make claims that have that scope that addresses the market development it just takes time that's why it's usually in continuation but what do we mean by IPR proofing I think this phrase gets thrown around a lot nowadays but what we sell an eye and gene we want to try to give you some actual things to do and one of the things I do a lot is with my D tenant claim so you might keep your independent claim the way that you would always want it with that particular scope but it's sometimes it's very common to have beef in a claim six to depend from five to ten from four depends from three and so with you think about it when you go to set up the pot the petitioner and an IPR goes to set up their ground of rejection all they have to do is have their primary reference and secondary reference for independent claim one and then they just tack on additional references to follow your little cascading water falling claim dependency instead consider setting up your dependent claim and to kind of three two three four different groups within each claim set so that it makes it harder for them to set up a ground of unpatentable 'ti for those multiple dependent claims i'm not saying do multiple z bennett claims but for two claims three four five for example so i would do like five depends from four depends from one and then maybe a claim where it's four and five together but now we're going to have claimed six and six depends from this so it sets up different permutations of claims goes and I talked about this a lot because we should all be telling our client says there is no such thing as one independent claim that's going to cover every circumstance of infringement and be completely valid so we need those different permutations of claim scope so I'm going to pause there Jean yeah I mean I think it's I'm all in favor of that I I think that that is an important consideration because one of the things I just was at le s last week and I was on a panel and we talked about how many patents do you or assets do you really need to have your portfolio sort of IPR proofed and the concept was how big does it have to be in order to get the defendant to want to really take a license versus finding it more more economical to challenge everything you have and of course that number varies depending upon what it is you're seeking who it is you're suing in what industry and etc but sometimes that number is quite a bit lower than a lot of people think it can be 10 or 15 good assets that are being infringed then when you do run the math it becomes more economical to take a license than it is to fight them so this is a great strategy what you're trying to do is you're trying to make it less attractive for them to file an IP are more expensive for them to file an IP are more expensive to file the petition just for the fee itself and more expensive for the lawyers fees and then you're adding a layer of uncertainty so I think it's a great great strategy Sal your thoughts yeah so I would add I mean just just think about what a petition would have to look like if you had your standard 20 claims three independent claim application to deal with where every single one of those 20 claims is unique in a in its own way and and the petitioner wouldn't be able to kind of attack you know the three independent claims as a group just addressing that their statutory classes or even address batch as a dependent claim so you know as Jennifer mentioned if you kind of switch to something closer to a hub-and-spoke type layout for your claims that's going to make a difference thinking about ways in which you can subtly vary even the independent claims can make a difference as well but also I mean you have so many opportunities to to make those defending claims count and prosecution and and if you've got a continuation pending that you can really target your claims down the road making sure that you've got a disclosure that will support not just kind of the broad concepts that you'd probably target initially but that you can target the infringer down the road I mean what better way to to IPR proof your patents than to get down to the embodiment level if you have you know what that embodiment is going to look like because you have a target you're probably in pretty good shape that's about as good as it's going to get ya and that brings up yeah go ahead join oh I was just going to piggyback off of what's out there because I really like his idea of using different independent claims with minor language tweak a couple of points on that sometimes when I get far into continuation process I'll hand the spec over to a different attorney and say don't look at any claims that are issued in this family just read the spec and go write your own set of claims because inevitably they're going to use different words or write the claim a different way and that has such value when you're trying to IPR proof and the kind of on that other on this a related note to that is think about and this is especially helpful in software think about what you can add for the claim that's not going to be in a primary or secondary reference what kind of limitation can you add it doesn't really narrow the claim because any infringers want to have to have it or especially for talking about a larger system where we can pull different components in because then they have to add another reference for their grounds of unpatentable ax t and from the p taos perspective when you start getting into three or four our reference combinations for unpatented bility especially for an independent claim the obvious 'no sub that independent claim becomes a lot less i mean yes the number of references was not indicative of non-obviousness but come on in reality they really are it becomes harder for the petitioner to make their ground of obvious enough yeah and i would i would certainly agree agree with that and what i was gonna say was i was going to point out that what Sal was talking about was really the probably the last two points on this page here about the continuations and one of the things my Bugaboo about this is it is shocking to me how often there is not an open continuation on an asset that is even quite valuable now i I get that if you work for a large corporation that's probably not your issue but it it is with startups it certainly is with with independent inventors it always is but it is with even well-funded startups you know there's they go they get a patent they they close the case and close the family and then it becomes valuable and there's nothing there there's and I hear this from litigators all the time too far too often that yeah you know it's a nice patent in all but you know I don't I the specification was open and we could write some more claims because if we could write some more claims this would be pretty good but you know once you close the family any claims you would ever be able to go back and get are gonna have intervening rights anyway so I like Jen you suggested that if you're gonna close it you can't just let it get closed with an email to the client right yes so often as prosecutors we have so much on our desk that we send our reminder emails like we're supposed to we don't hear back from the client deadlines pass but hey we've done what we're supposed to right we sent our reminders I will tell you in my office we don't practice that way and especially especially on continuations on continuations when we're to the point where we're about to decide to close a family I get my client on the line and I read them the riot act no matter who they are no matter their skill level no matter if they're in-house patent counsel for 15 years I want them on the phone going yes I understand the the issues that will happen and what I'm about to do in closing the family I mean this is such a big decision in the prosecution process and the client needs to be fully aware of the decision they're about today baby yeah and because you also I've talked with and if anybody has been on any setting on any presentations but with the the funders the money people the the financiers in the industry they are all looking for open files that's what they want they want open files because they know if there's open files they can IPR proof the stuff that they're gonna fund in litigation you know sure that the assets that are gonna get litigated are gonna get IPR but then once they get IPR they're gonna see the art they're gonna see the best swing then they're gonna go into the continuation and get better claims you know that's what the money people are looking for that's what the attorneys are looking for and if you have any hope of getting contingency representation in today's marketplace you absolutely I think have to have open continuations otherwise you're not going to get it you're just it's impossible now sell before we now I would add go ahead go ahead go ahead I I would add to that you know I think many times when when you don't have a particular target in mind for the claims you're you're kind of operating in a vacuum before there's been any sort of decision on you know a direction to assert maybe there aren't really any special competitors in that space that you can look at you know there's kind of the sense that okay well we got these really broad claims allowed and and that should weigh into that decision to close off the family and not file a continuation we can't really go any broader we're happy with what we've got we're done right but I mean if you look at that second bullet of this slide it's you know what what is the infer to have that you can tailor a narrower claim to I mean to IPR proof you're going to need to get to some level of specificity that the art isn't going to teach and and if you can get to that level of specificity by knowing what that target is and by making sure that when you draft your disclosure you've got concrete examples that you can point to you're gonna have a lot of flexibility down the road that what looked like broad claims initially and then you might be happy with I really you know that that's got its own set of challenges yeah and and that's a good segue to our to our next point in the last point on here is file robust technical disclosure and that brings us to the next slide which is best practices for a robust disclosure and the first point is mine and it's you know my Bugaboo and I say it all the time and I don't know whether I'm getting through to people or not because I hear all the time that there's this magic rule that evil words dirty words four-letter word invention you can't say the the present invention or the invention anywhere in your application and that is simply not the law that is simply wrong it's not what the cases say and if you if you follow that rule bright-line rule you can walk smack into the problem that the bright-line rule is there to prevent because what it should be viewed as as a warning that you should have a more robust disclosure and not only limit yourself to one articulation of an invention that has all the time certain components because when you look at the cases from the Federal Circuit the invention has always been described with a b c d and e every time it's been called the invention every problem has been described it's got those five elements well of course you don't have support for a claim that would cover four elements because you've never articulated it as having four elements so it's an in artful disclosure now what you can do is you can obviously wind up with that being your invention when you are using that in constantly calling the a and articulate I'm sorry an embodiment your invention without any other examples because and that's the Honeywell case right that's one of the cases where scared everybody to death it's like the public is entitled to take the patentee at his or her word well but don't don't miss the point that it was a defective disclosure it was or not may be defective but it was limiting it was a limiting disclosure and then the other next point up here is about explaining functionality hopefully everybody understands understands this but you know I run into this problem too and Jen this starts to get into some of your means plus function slides which we're going to be coming up to but I I'm surprised sometimes that people have in their mind that you can describe the function of a device and that will somehow make the device itself unique is that for me Jane yeah I mean do you have thoughts do you have thoughts on that yeah yeah and you see this in the software world whether it's just kind of pure internet-based software or software being performed by a particular device that's not just a general-purpose computer where especially if you're just not skilled at writing software applications you tend to go to describing as a function just like if you were doing mechanical applications you call everything a member for you know you have a generic firms that you're using just because you don't have the vocabulary yet so what so you really need to be thinking about and go back to your inventor if you have to but to find out this information of how is component a talking to component B and what is the function going on between these but how are they also communicating with each other or how is this interrelationship between these different models love this software how does it work having that even that little bit of background will help and I want if we do have younger attorneys on here I'll encourage you the older that I've gotten the more self-confidence I have in ability and being comfortable with what I don't know is what my point there because I don't know everything and I definitely didn't know everything when I first started practicing and I mentioned that because if you don't understand the functionality of the invention in addition to is kind of the hardware side go back to your inventor and have them explain it to you they love talking about their inventions I don't care if they're a fortune 100 company or the solo startup they love talking about it and they'll appreciate the questions and you digging down to find those answers yeah yeah and you know and I just go ahead so I was I was just going to add to that you know we see a lot of usage of phrases like based on in software and and you know this some tasks some some algorithm is performed based on something else and there's a situation where that's fine and there's a situation where you want to make sure you've got the right terminology for that if that relationship is not really where you're you're trying to hang your hat on for for embeddedness you know you're not going to argue that that limitation is your hook to get around obvious Nisour certainly not for 101 then keeping that relationship broad using kind of based on language is fine perhaps but if if that's the limitation that you're really going to say you're going to point to and say okay that is distinguished from from the art for these reasons based on isn't going to cut it and the examiner is going to call you on that you'll you'll definitely realize it and so having the right language to describe those relationships for the claim is going to be helpful but also you know it's not just going to be a phrase that you're going to throw into your specification you're probably going to have you know to your next point of a flowchart that describes what exactly is going on when you say X step right so so yeah I would look for those kind of like nonce relationships and and figure out okay does it need to be at this level of breath or can I articulate a tighter relationship yeah and you know it's the same there's no in the mechanical world like adapted to and adapted for I mean you read that and it's like what what does that mean what is it cover and people seem to think that that's limiting and you know it can be limiting and depending on the specification you know I mean and it can also be just a term that doesn't carry any meaning whatsoever you know so you have to be really careful and that's why the disclosure matters so much and it's not just with software it's it's everything I mean this is really a disclosure revolution that's what Joseph Joe root who's written a book on patent claim drafting in an patent drafting for it's a lot lexus publication he calls it the disclosure revolution and you know he's right I mean there if it's not in your description you're you're out of luck it's it has to be there it cannot be thin it must be real and it has to be technical and then my next bullet point is drawings or your best friend you know I and this is for every application I think there are too few drawings filed in probably at least 95% of applications I mean they're cheap they're easy to get and they disclose so much and they force you to write and describe more you know and people are always asking me for good examples and some of you probably know that John White and I we started teaching a patent practice course for for beginners and one of the patents that we use as an example a family is a the family to the ring video doorbell and if you look at those patents that cover the ring video doorbell there are dozens of illis durations drawings in those patents and of everything from flowcharts the schematics to screenshots to you know shots showing the video to interfaces to graphs to you know absolutely everything that they could possibly think about showing in order to describe what is actually going on and you know I think you need to do that right right Jenna me that's what makes these types of inventions real it turns it into a system not software it really does and even talking about an outside of the prosecution context it's also really important for IPRs and for litigation I know on the litigation side that we as a when we're the representing the plaintiff we love to have those patent drawings because they're easily understandable by a jury you know we can see things visually and understand it much better especially if it's very difficult concepts and then for the prosecution side remember what you're dealing with with an examiner they don't have a lot of time to examine your application they probably have not read every single word of your specification but I can almost guarantee you they flip through the drawings and so if you have a lot of drawings showing the invention from the beginning you put them in a state of this isn't interesting maybe there's something here for patentability purposes yeah yeah and my go ahead so I was going to say you know sometimes we get kind of mired in in all the latest cases and everything sometimes it really helps to go back to basics you know exactly what I would be teaching my students right now about the use of drawings is first off keep in mind that drawings are just embodiments right there they're reflective of embodiments they're not the invention right and and second you know one of the first things that we're all kind of taught about how to use drawings is you know after you've got your claims in place or at least you know representative claims set you put your drawings together and then you can talk through the draw with your specification so if you're not doing that you're making it harder for yourself you're making it harder to kind of meet your clients budgets too because by the time you've got your full drawing set in place and you've walked through all of the various embodiments reflected in those drawings you've got your narrative in place you can tell a story you can do kind of that next level sort of I you know extemporaneous you know talking about your your invention in in just narrating through those drawings so it's a you can't discount the value of a well crafted not just set of drawings but an organization for those drawings yeah III couldn't agree any any more whatsoever now I'm looking at the clock we got 15 minutes left we're probably not gonna get to everything I had hoped to get to but I want to push to the next slide because I want to get at least touch at least some on this means plus function stuff Jen this was from a slide deck that you had done previously so I'll let you drive through this one if you'd like sure um we all know 112's but I'm sure many of you have recently experienced in the past couple of years more of a focus from the Patent Office on interpreting claims under 112 F and so I have given a 112 as functional claiming presentation a few times and it really focuses on Williamson V Citrix which is a 2015 case so it's been around for a while but it's the one that is being applied by the Patent Office and interpreted so a couple of things with 112 F you probably are seeing more rejections you're probably seeing more rigid our interpretations as you say of 112's even in a software let alone the mechanical and electromechanical world my biggest thing here is to get away from using nonce terms and the patent office icing is broadly interpreting what a nonce term is so Williamson came in and said a nonce term is essentially some adjectives followed by device and that word device is a nonce term and it's really replacing the means so you have a situation where you have adjectives plus device so moving device or pivoting mechanisms configured for are adapted to perform punch punch some function the patent office is saying look you're taking the word means for a function and replacing it with this not term we're going to interpret it under 112 F try to get away from using those nonce terms we keep on I think we've gotten to using them because they've been so prolific in prosecution and how we write application but for example the light capturing element don't call it a light capturing element um come up with a more generic term but it does not include a nonce term and then my other big thing with respect to the 112's is I think a lot of examiner's don't really believe that it's 112 F but they need to put it on the record and they need you to respond back why it's not 112 F in other words why a field person would understand that the moving device is used in the claims and then the specification would be understand by a field person to mean a particular device as opposed to this generic concept in word but pushback I mean unless you want them interpreted under 112's but if you don't and you see that in your office action you need to be either amending your claims or responding because otherwise that one tool of F interpretation is going to follow you all throughout any future litigation or post grant now Jen and Sal I have this question for you guys now what is the harm if any in your view of having several no I'm not saying like the entirety of the claims but having a claim set that is means plus function does that provide any concerns when you look at the patents so if it's software arm I might be a little bit concerned about written description and the support for for any of the the you know the means was function terms but apart from that I you know it's just it's good practice to bury your claims and we were talking about IPR proofing your your patents before guess what a petitioner has to do if you come up with meaningful function claims they have to define the term and they need it they need to provide their claim construction on the means this function language right up front and maybe it's maybe it's to your advantage maybe it's not but it's just it's more work and and if it's not if you're not putting all of your eggs in that basket it's just another tool so it's one of those things again that we've sort of gotten away from because of all the negative implications of means this function language the how limiting it is if nothing else but it's still a tool in your toolbox and if used appropriately it gives your your patent even more flexibility yeah and I agree with that and I would also say and Jenna I'd like you to get your thoughts on this too I would also say I would not be afraid to use means plus function even in software now I understand about the algorithm cases and I know what that means about the level of disclosure that you're gonna have to have but it is a tool you know either way I look at means plus function language particularly with software is it's an extremely heavy garlic you know a little bits gonna go a long way if it's not oft where in means plus function languages doesn't create the same level of anxiety and it protects everything that's in the specification and you're never gonna get the budget to write all the claims that you could write to cover everything you've disclosed in a well-written specification anyway so it what I would throw in a few of those claims you know and the other thing too I hear from patent litigators and this I think some surprises patent prosecutors but the patent litigators I talk to always say give me means claims where are the means plus function claims I want means plus function claims and I think it's because of what you just said Sal you know it the defendant has to define these terms it adds uncertainty into the process you know at anytime there's uncertainty in the process that that makes that more likely that you're gonna have an opportunity to settle Jen thoughts on any of what we've been talking about there yeah I'll agree with both of you I think Southpoint he started out saying in general he wouldn't necessarily recommend how and if it words he meant sell for software and the reason is because it exposes the weaknesses that you haven't properly defined your algorithm because that is the structure so if you properly defined your algorithm for all the reasons that we've already talked about then you shouldn't have a problem so you could kind of also think of it as a test for have I done it yeah I mean if you haven't done it then you are shooting yourself in the foot because it does expose that weakness but I also like means the function and I've actually started doing a few maybe for the first time in well over a decade have I started putting good good for you the thing is I know that there's academics out there that that are saying that they think with software the way that these patent specifications should be interpreted is all of them should be interpreted as means plus function meaning that if all of the algorithms are not disclosed then the specification is defective regardless of what claim technique you used now that has not caught on yet but who's to say that that won't catch on you know so I like to say in and we're probably not gonna have time to get to the real good conversation on the the budget that I wanted to do so we'll have to do that another day but I understand client budgets but if you get a client that's willing to pay you to do what needs to be done what like a well-funded startup that's gonna have this as a foundational document you're gonna wanna I think file the specification so you could use means plus function claims if you wanted to i 100% agree um I never sangre and then kind of a couple of quick two points on that is do you consider them for when you get pretty far in your continuation practice if you're on your third fourth fifth continuation - well you need a variety of Claim scope anyway and also consider kinetically I mixed media claims you can maybe call it where not every single element in the claim is a meaningful function claim but maybe one of them is especially helpful in mechanical and electromechanical where you have good disclosure for perhaps one concept and you want to just be able to catch everything getting me and so something like that yeah now I think that this is probably the last substantive slide we're gonna get to unfortunately but this is uh I just wanted to I can drive through this one pretty quickly but this is what I've heard and we've written some of this an articles on IP watchdog from examiner's regarding 112 issues and the the the one thing that comes up a lot when you talk to examiner's is they they really want you to check your specifications and claims - but really they want you to file things that don't have obvious 1-12 deficiencies now at the bottom here I think one of the examiners puts the finger on where a lot of these problems come from and it's with foreign translations if possible please check and correct any foreign translations before they get to the examiner and this is that's a direct quote all examiner's despise how much time despised was the examiner zord despise how much time it takes to sort them through them when for most of us time is our most precious resource so they v1 twelve rejections as a waste of their time and if you're filing things that have got a bunch of 112 issues you're you're starting off on the wrong foot and you're wasting the firt you're just throwing throw in the first action away you're flushing it down the toilet and you know that's that's unfortunate and you know let me let me just the last couple slides here before we wrap up because LexisNexis is is the sponsor of this webinar and our sponsors make all this possible to bring to you guys for free and they have a tool that helps with with 1:12 specifically and it's called patent optimizer and you can go through it and it can check your words and make sure that what you're using in the back is what you're using in the claims and that you've defined things and that you're not using any of what what we would call patent profanity and it's gonna get you into trouble and make sure that everything's got proper basis and and the part of it that I really like here is this as a will check your drawings and make sure that everything that you've used in the drawings and numbered labeled in the drawings is actually discussed in the specification and check for consistency and accuracy and you know that these little things matter they're very important but they matter so we're not gonna have a lot of time to talk about that but if you want a test drive please follow up with Maria Moreno and here's your contact information and give patent optimizer a check if you're if you're in the market I really would appreciate it if you would you would do that they make these possible for us and they've been a long time very good sponsor for IP watchdog so guys we're in the last couple minutes that we have left what I would want to do is try and put a bow on this for everybody who's who's here I'll ask both of you the same question what do you want people to leave remembering what is the one or two things that is the most important to weave into their daily practice based on where we are 20:18 Jenn I'll start with you and then Sal I'll give you the final word Jenn yeah I think when we're drafting these long specs we can sometimes get caught up in trying to say things elegantly and with proper words usage and just making a pretty document and sometimes I tell my team members step back and say what you really mean describe the invention look at it what do you see where do you think that cool factor is why is this thing is advantageous remember remember why things should be able to get patents and if you step back and look at it that way I think it really helps to evolve your patent application as opposed to again that regimented this is the way I'm supposed to do it and these are the words I'm supposed to use yeah yeah that's really good advice Sal your your final final thoughts what do you what do you people need to leave remembering so they can weave into their their daily lives yeah I mean I think people get told way too often what not to do and they internalize that very easily you know I'll just stop doing background sections I'll stop doing this with that but you have to remember all the different tools you have in your toolbox and you know when there's a challenge you know like Jennifer said step back think about the concepts think about how you're going to convey them and then look through your entire toolbox because you have all of these options available to you to tell this story to you know convince a juror convince a judge convinced you know somebody is going to be licensing your patent whatever the audience may be that there is truly something innovative here and you really need to be thinking about it from all those different perspectives and using your full toolbox effectively yeah I think that's you know a great great advice and consuming where I would leave it is my final parting thought would be and I've said this you know many many times is is that the person who this document needs to be relevant to is that hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art though that skilled person is who were writing this for and I think a lot of times anymore we've started writing these applications so that they are a bit dumbed down so that Joe average can understand them and the problem is is if you really have a unique innovation in 2018 Joe average might not be able to understand the science the physics the software the biology chemistry whatever the case may be so at some point Joe average probably should stop being able to understand the patent and it should be a technical document a thick technical disclosure now I'm not saying trying to try and make it so that people can't understand it or it's hard to read but it has to be true to the invention and I think sometimes you get reading these things and the judges understand them too much so they sometimes think well I understand this it can't really be an invention and and maybe that may I'm projecting but I'm a big fan of the thick technical disclosures thin just doesn't cut it anymore and that's coming from the fat guy so all right so hopefully you guys got had some fun here today I really appreciate you joining us Jen Sal thank you so much thank you Jeannie and thank you Gail and thank you and we'll hopefully see everybody on a future webinar take care",

        "transcript": "hello in this recording of our justia webinar generative AI in patent Drafting and prosecution bowran offers a balanced view of ai's potential in law provides an overview of AI tools particularly those that apply to patent law and emphasizes the importance of understanding and adhering to ethical guidelines when incorporating AI into legal work remember if you'd like to see more jusa videos on law practice and legal marketing be sure to subscribe to our Channel good morning everybody um so uh my name is bowran and thank you so much Nina for the uh kind introduction um so I like to before we get started I'd like to provide a little background of my my experience and why it's relevant so uh about 28 years ago I was with fish and Richardson uh and um one of my startup CL one of my clients was a startup uh Align Technology and uh they had this cute technology to move your teeth using computer fabricated Dental appliances and so that sounded interesting uh and uh so the company ultimately raised his series A's uh funding from Kleiner Perkins and um then they asked me to uh you know to join them and to help them as a startup and at the time uh all my colleagues were jumping to do this is I think around 1999 time frame uh and so uh of course uh not knowing any better I jumped to a dental device company and uh that you know everybody initially laughed at me and uh but in the end after the Doom crash I guess I had the last laugh so Al went public and the rest of it is history so uh we we you know have like a you know in in in in doing work from both as outside Council and as from from an in-house perspective I've gained um you know quite a a number of uh uh interesting uh experience along the way so uh anyway after uh align we I started I helped a lot of startup companies and they the the need to become efficient uh was was Paramount because uh startups really don't have much uh uh you you really can't spend a huge amount of time on them you have to be very efficient with a work product and so uh that's where I think my interest um uh over time evolve over into how we can make our workflow more efficient and that's when I U uh uh started the power patent uh software process um the software is not meant to uh to replace lawyers but to be an arment uh to our workflow so um with that background I'm going to go into the to you know to the next slide so um so with that background uh I can tell you a little bit about how AI is going to be changing our practice uh first of all uh AI will impact in the drafting side of it uh and it's going to make our workflow more efficient reducing it from you know an average of let's say 20 hours per patent application and trimming it down to perhaps 5 to 10 hours uh so that's um uh you know uh in in the drafting side and in the respond to the office action it's also going to help in reducing the time to deal with the um uh the main you know independent claim uh and because AI can easily apply the same methodology to the dependent claim we can come up with a much more uh robust um response to um to The Examiner and in my experience uh when you present them with a full discussion of each claim as though you were uh pushing back on the independent claim they tend to be more um uh you know in in in the mindset of okay how can we work with you in moving this case forward and so uh as a result of that we we beginning to find uh increasing adoption among the law firms and as well as the the corporation the in-house lawyers in in the corporation uh and certainly we've seen significant Venture investment in the Tool uh all you have to do is go to Y combinator and you're going to find that they funded at least two or three different companies in the space so that's the background environment we're in so what are the key benefits of using Ai and what's the poent more importantly what's the downside right so the first thing we see is that a substantial time saving uh in both the Drafting and also in the office action responses we see that they're going to have better um uh response because now it'll give you more time to go into each dependent claim and arguing them as though they're spending as much time on them as as though you're doing the the independent claims um and um sometimes these AI will give you different views on how you can push back on a rejection um yeah because they draw from a different uh set of perspectives than if you were just a human looking at okay here's the reference here are the um here are the the sections that the examiner relied on the AI can actually look at the totality of the um uh of the P of the uh of the reference and and argue as to uh why the combination wouldn't operate so um uh AI has also Al been used for prior art and there are a number of solutions that would provide uh you with very good um uh natural language search capabilities as well as uh image search capability and so the result of all of this is that you have not only a more comprehensive patent application but also you have an entire um uh you know Cradle to grave support uh of the uh um the drafting the prosecution and also in the resulting licensing uh and so the software can some of the software tools will look up potential licensing candidate for you uh at the tail end and so I think there's significant support for patent lawyers in helping the clients from protecting the invention from getting the patent as well as um licensing and benefit monetizing the patent portfolio so some of the tools we've seen uh use uh certainly is uh if we look at the this corner right here the patent classification end ofit we've seen um you know the the AI helpful in terms of looking at the claims as well as the language and it would help then Focus you to um to um just to modify your language so that it's going to get into a particular art unit that's suitable for you uh AI also has been use in evidence abuse collection so basically for uh claim infringement analysis and claim charting analyses that I mentioned earlier so the AI is also used in uh invention disclosure so um we find that the universities and many research organizations they have PD F the the in the inventors would publish as a PDF into a technical Journal such as let's say the i e uh the AI can take that invention disclosure and then directly convert the first draft for you and you can use that draft to file either as a uh provisional application if you uh don't have the time to to work on the case and you should simply use the output from the paper and augment the uh the application and the paper and file that as a provisional and so the result of that is you're going to have a um uh a u wellform patent application with full support from the uh the um the uh the PDF disclosure if needed um and of course we mentioned AI has been used in the searching uh as well as also uh invalidity of patents as well so you got the the yin and the Yang of it you can be used in the patent drafting as well as in uh also for litigation purposes a detail prior art search and uh you know it's a full circle there right so that's that's the the two AI to available uh for the patent life cycle so let's do a quick comparison of AI tools versus the traditional methods um so in an AI uh in a traditional approach what we do is we craft the claims first and then we get the drawings and then we annotate the drawings with uh the reference numerals uh and then you write the uh the drawing sequentially and uh in a long application you can the uh potential typos and errors can prop up so for example you may miss the uh you may site to the incorrect number reference number um uh and um uh and sometimes you may not use words that are identically match between the claims and the description so those are just the um you know just inherently when you write a long document is is potentially prone to those uh mistakes the AI tools on the other hand uh they can enforce uh computer methodology so that your application is precise and you can have a more uh comprehensive approach and what do I mean by that um so when you write an application you have certain terminologies that you may need to have let's say um um uh definitions let's say you may have um uh a a a particular uh a word that could be defined and it it can the the computer can automatically generate that for uh the the definitions for you the computer can automatically expand the drawings and it can also uh when it describes the drawing because it's drawing from a bigger database of information uh it can uh be uh provide a more comprehensive review uh a I'm sorry a more comprehensive discussion of the drawing now combine that with a human review and edit that results in a uh in a in a an improv work product so to me the AI tools can be used uh it's not meant to replace the lawyers but it's really a um an augmentation for the lawyers to uh to to write faster so patents the leading patent tools will all enable you to draft the first draft very quickly with minimum input most of them will be able to take a claim and then generate a patent applications from them uh you can adjust the claims and then it'll refine the text according to the claim then um you know some tools will allow you to take in the drawings and then expand and elaborate on the drawings uh like the way a a a a person uh would would write other tools will also enable you to generate flowcharts automatically but I have not found any tools that can take the the drawings and automatically generate the the the drawings from the claim so that's something that's still an evolving um uh Tool uh that's something I think in the future that would be nice to have um the um so the AI tool when you write the claim they can also do a search and that search can then be used as feedback for you to improve the writing of the claims uh and that's a nice uh particularly a nice uh ability uh we're also seeing a trend where the ai2 in addition to doing the prior search they would also look for prospective lenses uh so that way you uh when you write your claims you can also have both the um validity side of it and also the licensing side of it and one of the best practices for using AI tools so we recommend that we use you use AI as an assistant we definitely uh do not want uh you shouldn't let it lose to write the application without a human review because um it it's it's simply not a replacement uh it can augment your knowledge base you can write it and you can ask it to describe something in more details and then you can edit it and control it but uh definitely do not let it run on its own um the uh the AI some of these AI tools also allow the inventors to be involved in the process through a collaborative uh where the inventors can go in and review the applications and then change it and then you as the lawyer uh uh and the inventors can collaborate on writing the application uh and Version Control is certainly a very good way of of of seeing um who contributed to what the the um so in a in an AI based system what you have is potentially um you know the the the usual uh hallucination uh and uh and also confidentiality issues right but on top of that for patent generation you have to deal with also inventorship issue whether or not uh the AI is a co-inventor and so let me address uh the the confidentiality issue first um so most the most solutions these days they are they are uh they use open AI uh the GPT as the backend engine and so GPT um when you use a free as a free version they will definitely um uh you know that information could be used for training purposes but when you use the version with an a with an application program interface I.E a paid version the information you have uh you know under contract open AI will not utilize that information for their own training purposes so there's no um confidentiality issue there uh many lawyers have looked at this and I think that they uh the conclusion is with the a API uh that addresses the confidentiality issue number one number two is uh part of the advantage of using a is that you will file the application very quickly and so if you do that your patent application has an earlier priority data anyway so there's no uh in Tod extent I say if AI leaks this information if any right uh then then from a from an inventor's perspective they can catch that um in in in the infringement basis increased because now you are patent pending so to me that's those are the two ways of solving the the confidentiality issue is first is under contract with uh openai or any other llm companies that you have conf that the data will not be used and secondly because your your speed of drafting application is so much increase um there will be less of a risk of of uh of that being coming back to haunt the uh the the applicant so let's discuss the inventorship issue the AI um you know I think under all jurisdictions um a human has to be an inventor I I think the only exception is is South Africa but even there I think that it's it's uh it's um it's safer not to utilize the AI as the uh as the inventive entity so how do we control inventorship we control that by using the claims because inventorship is based on the claims so if um if the humans write the claim and the system simply explain and describe the invention based number one on the claim and based on the um the drawings that's a very tight way of way of controlling the inventorship issue because um uh because you you've limited the machine to to uh to writing things that were created by the inventor uh and then of course the the pr the editing the post editing phase is another way that you can go to check on the inventorship issue so I think that between the um the fact that the humans wrote you know the the humans writing the claim and the drawings and the editing uh you really view the AI as uh as really your assistant your your co-pilot and that minimizes the inventorship issue so this slide discusses the confidentiality issue um uh if we use a system that is under is contractually obligated not to uh to use your data for future training uh that is uh a way to uh increase your um uh confidentiality and we've talked a lot of a lot of of that in there uh another safe way to use the AI is to use that in patent in addressing patent examination so uh when you so that the use of AI in address in in traversing a rejection uh is very similar to the way the AI is used for searching patents for prior art in in both of those cases you do not have a problem with uh confidentiality because it's all based on publicly available information so this slide again is is basically about uh using a vendor with clear uh privacy and data retention policies uh you should periodically re uh review the the practices for AI usage um there is also a need to track as far as uh inventorship so the solution you use should provide a paper trail for who contributed to certain aspects of patent Drafting and uh so that's the um the so the system that you use should provide detail records of invention of inventor Communications uh there specific editing of the application uh and also it should track uh you know what part of the application was was machine based and what part of it was coming from the inventor so this is a paper trail that would be used for uh useful for uh software in AI drafting so uh with respect to the client communication we believe that you well you need to tell the client that you're using AI um and so as part of the communication you should explain the benefits which is uh cost saving and speed and the risk uh which is basically potentially um the exposing your information to the you know the potential uh you address the the confidentiality aspect uh with with the um API agreements with the llm vendor right uh and uh and so you're balancing the cost savings versus the the uh the the risk of using Ai and you should get uh client consent for AI usage um and update uh the clients on um advancements in the tools so in concl solution um we we we believe that 2025 will be the year for AI tool adoption we've already seen a large firm uh going on the record indicating that they're going to be using uh AI in the pent prosecution and drafting as side of it so um you need to uh observe certain ethical considerations I.E Communications with the client um be aware of the confidentiality and checking for making ensuring that the the the model usage is correct um and uh however uh I think many of these these uh confidentiality confirms the the concerns and let's say uh and the fear of bias in the system and the fear of uh hallucination they will pass over time um and long term we believe that AI tools represent a paradigm shift in the patent practice in uh in for law firms early adoptions provides competitive advantages as well as continuous uh learning and uh uh in the way so uh with that in mind uh I will uh transition before before I transition to a demo of an existing software and how this is done uh is there any questions in the audience that I need to um um is there any question Nina or anything that I should answer before I transition to a demo no open question I don't see any open so feel free to go ahead and transition thanks B sure all right uh let's see if I can share my screen and let's say okay so um let's go to a typical um app in AI patenting so this particular application is um is power patent and um we will show you how to prepare a patent application from scratch how how easy it is so let's go to the prepare application so in this particular case the app has uh five different ways you can you can uh provide information to it you can start with the claims and upload the drawings you can start with an invention oops invention disclosure so let let me go back you can start with an invention disclosure and so by that that what I mean is you can let's say for University you can take a publication and upload it uh and it will generate a first draft for you to review you can do a conventional drafting where you can go through let's say uh you know enter in your usual name and then you know ask it to generate a background for the invention and then you can upload your drawings and then ask it to uh to generate text from the drawing for you you can also import a word application uh this I find it to be useful let's say if you have a template uh let's say you have a computer um uh um a mobile app application where you you have generic figure one is a is a is a smartphone you can import that template using this and then it'll generate the the rest of the application from that template and of course you can also import from Google doc um so let's start with the uh the claims uh first so in a claim what I will do is I'm just going to take a patent applic a claim from a a patent application let's say uh 8 million we we're just going to clone in the um the claims of 8 million patent and we're also going to borrow the uh the drawings from that so I will show you how we do that [Music] okay all right so in the 8 million patent uh they have a set of claims so let's say they have 12 claims so what we do is we copy in the the claim set from that issue patent that's all you really need to do is to paste in the claim uh then it can generate the application straight from the claim or you can add images to it and so what we'll do is um I will show you how we we can upload a set of drawings okay and uh I'm just going to upload a patent with all the drawings and I'm just going to remove them so here we see that so basically what we have now is uh a set of drawings and you can see that right that's all you really need it will automatically generate the part description for you uh if you have some inventor notes you know the way I normally do it is I'll I'll have the drawings and then I'll ask the inventor to okay please go through this um you know uh this figure and describe why it's significant and we can just go through all that and we uh record that and we'll put it into here and the advantage of doing that is that now um what you uh the inventor will describe the part list for you the reference numeral but in this case let's just go without it all you do is you click on the Draft application and you'll see that uh right now it's 11:33 right uh it should be done by um in about 3 to 4 minutes and you'll see that it will generate a very detailed disc description by expanding on the claims and by expanding on the description of the drawings and they'll track uh you know the the the the correspondence should the drawing so where where that source of description is coming from so you can see that in this case the computer didn't just randomly on its own invent this this is a human control human generated invention with specific drawing and specific uh claim and all the computer is doing is just describe the The Invention uh and so now you're seeing that it's it's generating so while it's doing that um let me describe another feature that uh we we will show you Downstream uh we've tried the um uh the response to the office action and the way we've used this tool to respond to office action is uh the tool will automatically download the XML files of the office action as well as the prior claims um and uh and also the uh prior Arts that's being used and then what it does is uh it'll respond to each uh um rejection uh and in particular it it will reference the MP in the in in the response so that it'll tell the um the reader you know the source of the reason why we're re we're we're we're traversing the rejections and then also the mp uh section that support that and we'll show that to you very shortly um as soon as this thing is done processing it's taking it's now about two minutes so give it another minute or so and you'll see that that is working the work product let's see and meanwhile if anybody has any questions please let me know uh Nina and then and I can answer that as well so when it finishes you'll see that it'll transition to a screen where it'll show you all the um the different parts of the application ah there it is it's done so we started at 10 11:33 and now it's 113 36 so you'll see that from the claim it automatically picks the title for you it puts in a very short background uh it will summarize the claim into the summer into the uh brief into the summary of The Invention uh if you want you can also ask it to generate additional advantages for you and then the abstract is basically uh taking the first uh paragraph of the summary and restate as the abstract so let's go to the description so here what we have is uh it it detect autod detected from the drawing five is a strap but if you don't like that you can edit that right uh one is an unknown part so that happens to be um the uh I guess part of the uh the the the glass frame so it could be uh one so you can edit the um the diagram so this is uh the a frame I'm going to call that and five is it's labeling that as but I I would call it as a uh um eyeglasses so you can edit that so you and um wearing a pair of AR plus so you can edit that okay and um and you repeat this process but here you can you know since it couldn't identify this the way um you would help it identify is by by pacing in the inventor interview and we could have done that but we didn't do that in this case so and since this particular drawing didn't have any any texts it couldn't figure out which part it is so you're going to have to enter in um you're going to have to Ma you know you have to manually enter in uh let's see what this guy is it also couldn't detect these particular what label parts are um but once you identify the the label into here then uh it will um uh you can you can ask it to generate text basically so um oops so this particular uh you will see in here that the uh it the software start describing the the figures in here um and it's it's a fairly lengthy description my guess it's going to be around 20 pages of that the uh so you can edit with this and it will also give you the uh the part list and and you you'll notice here that it's automatically identifying the parts for you in this particular U so it basically in this is telling you that we need to go back and edit the brief description but for now we're for for just demo we'll just skip that so you can go into here and you can describe uh you can select your um your boiler plate in different sections if you want or you can use your own boiler plate here for claims you you can um so here's the claims that you entered and it automatically generated a sketch uh of the uh of the claim for you and you can you if you want to change the position you can just drag and drop it you can also do a search in this particular uh so what it's doing here is uh it's mapping the uh the claim language into the prior art uh and so since we copy these claim from an issue patent um it it basically detected that right here the visual prosthesis and it's right now doing the mapping so if you'll give it a little while you're going to see that it's start mapping out the U where the uh the clean yeah there it is so it'll it'll bring back the prior art and it'll say it it'll attempt to find out where your um your language is ma into the uh into the prior art and so you can review the priority and then amend and change your claim if you want and uh so they are doing a version of this now for also for um trying to see how how your claim would potentially uh you know be um be used in the commercial side I.E potential the the claim coverage side of it for monetization side so that's a little bit of the the demo on on on claim editing here's a diagnostic and uh so what it does is it'll identify uh occurrences of text in in um uh potentially is being confused so here somehow we have a text that says a reference sign 10 uh and and the other term is laptop 10 so it it identified that you that there are potential inconsistencies between 10 and laptop or reference signs um and so here also it's it's uh it's identifying where the um the term is used right in the description and this is also good for means plus function analysis so for example if you say me if the if the application reference is a means sub communication it'll tell you okay where is you know what is mentioned in here so that's the diagnostic part of it um you can also get a PDF of the that reports the uh it's it's um it reports your your usage so you'll see it here your claim your intercedent basis issues if any and uh your support So in this case um there there's no error uh and um you can export it as a weird document as well so now you're going to see what what the patent application looks like and so many people prefer the uh the document straight as a Word document so now you'll see it and let's scroll through that so this is just from the claims and from the figures you're going to see that it's generating uh approximately 25 pages of text with the figures in there for you um so a fairly rapid way of dealing with um drafting your creating your first draft for what I've seen it TP it will generate I think in about um um 10 about about 5 to 10 minutes they'll generate the first draft and then I'm going to spend two or three hours editing it uh and I would and and it would be a work product that you can send out for client review so that that's my experience with that so let's go back to so that basically concludes the drafting side of it let's go to the docking side of it so what we do here is in a doting site um we have a way of communicating with the uh the patent office uh the patent Center and download that information into here so it's kind of like a very simple uh docket function but it's real power is in the fact that it can actually download uh the um uh it can download an office action right and so and and respond to that so uh as an example here so when it downloads an office action you can uh ask it to generate a response live uh or the way I run it is I I typically let it run overnight and then it will generate all the responses already and then now I can just pick it up and uh ask it to and review the the the potential response for it right so here it summarizes the rejection uh and then uh and then here it starts to respond to the 10 103 101 and 103 rejection uh let me see yeah here it's responding to the 10 101 rejection C right here and it does this um by you know Bas on the uh PTO guidance right uh and then you'll start seeing also it's responding to the 103 rejection here it is it starts here so um and the way it does that is it downloads a reference uh each reference and then it'll attempt to analyze the reference and argue as to why the combination would be inoperative and so um the machine you know comes up with sometimes a reason that is actually better than uh than a human but I think the way I use it is is a collaboration I look at how the uh the office action um you know what if you know its reason for why the combination wouldn't work and then I come up with my own independent reason on why the combination would be an operative uh so I do that for the independent claim but for the dependent claim I more or less uh use the um the the output that it generate because I just don't have time to go down into the details of each each and every indep dependent planes so uh and you can see that it's it's doing this for every every claim and that's something that I won't have time to go and drill down on on in detail for each cling so um um so the way I use that is is to use that as an argument and then I'll look at it to see if the reasoning is correct then I use it and and if the reason is weak then I use my own reason but um it it it can using this tool I can do an an office action responds also in about two to three hours because I can just review its work and if I think uh I need to supplement it then I'll do so but in general it's it's a it has a very reasonable argument as to why a combination wouldn't work so that's basically uh an overview of the uh the office action response uh I think we're running up close to time so Nina you're showing up so are there questions or things like that I need to answer yeah so we have a couple questions about the actual tool so let's see the first one here is are there any available official actions yet that reject claims based in invention by AI uh well I think there was one case uh I forgot the name but there was a a um is it a Australian inventor where they um you know they they applied in in in numerous jurisdictions in Europe they got rejected in the US they got rejected um and in South Africa I think they got it granted in South Africa either South Africa or Australia uh but only one one country in the world um uh approve a a pat that was um invented by AI so in that case the AI was generating various shapes that has particularly advantageous um functions and so because the AI created those shapes uh they decided to apply uh for the application using the AI as an inventor and that name of that case escaped me but that case ultimately went through Europe and the US and both jurisdictions rejected that not human originated inventions awesome thank you for that Insight um our next question is about the tool itself so are you uploading jpeg or JPG files or are they actually drawing files from Vio or something similar uh the that particular tool power patent can take any anything jpeg uh PowerPoint word um basically uh what it does is dep Pi it Tak all those files and convert them into uh a uh ultimately the jpeg image and then it works from there so so they can convert they can take a number of of um uh formats and convert them into a common format for them to for it to work on okay great that's great to know um and then this person also said when you were going through the different figures it said they were still labeled inside the figure file with the original 8 million patent number so had the original patent number um if you're using this example to create a new application like if it was a brand new application would it still keep that patent number or would it be brand new uh I'm sorry there was another phone on my computer and I could you repeat the question again no that's okay um so they were just asking about some of the figures that were inside the figure file they had the original patent number that they were associated with if you're using this tool power patent to start a new application would it still pull over that patent number oh I I use that just for demo in a real patent application you you uh of course you know you wouldn't be using a patent drawing for an issue pan drawing as your input uh so um I use that just for pure uh you know uh expediency but in in a real application you would create your own app drawing either by hand or you know using a professional draftsman uh and then you would upload those drawing either as a a PDF file or image file individually or a PowerPoint and it would automatically take that so you wouldn't see those drawings in a normal application that was just for example so sorry about that well that's okay thanks for clarifying um and then this person just asked a follow-up question um Can it says but you can use an issued or at least pending patent whenever you're doing a CIP or continuation okay yes uh well if you have a continuation already then you have the original drawing I would use those drawing and um you know we we are working uh you know the I've I've requested that the the the feature be be allowed so that you can crop out the the image but that's something that's probably you know uh early next year that you're going to see but so you can crop basically and and that's the way you would handle also multiple images in a single page as well understood thank you all right and then it looks like I'm just going to open it up to more general questions um now that we're kind of done looking at the tool together um so if anyone has any more general questions then please feel free to submit them you can click on the Q&A button in the control panel at the bottom of your screen looks like we've already got a couple coming in so this next question is about billable hours so please explain the benefit oops sorry it jumped um please explain the benefit to the patent attorney when you're billing a client for Less hours and so like 10 hours instead of 20 hours how do you navigate that what is that look like for you in your practice well I think um you know for those lucky one that can build by the hour um you know this tool um I think um you have to explain it differently for many of us where we are on fixed fee so for example uh with a company uh you might be you know committing to let's say 7 to $8,000 uh the use of this tool is particularly advantageous because well it it it you know the the fixed fee rewards efficiency right now I think for the majority of pent prosecutor will un fixed fee for the lucky fee who are on uh hourly fee Arrangement the the way I view this tool is that the tool is not meant to replace lawyers it's is meant to give you more um a different perspective on how you um it'll give you more time to talk to your inventors and explore okay uh what other alternative possible use of this invention could you contemplate so um you know it it give you time to uh to spend with the client and to show your added Val you and yet yet you know keep your bill in a reasonable range so one of the things that we talked about is you know generally most inventors think about what they've just in they they they invented just right in their specific context but we as lawyers rarely have the time to push them to the next level to say well uh what other application could you see this technology be applicable in and how would you modify it to take care of that application what other industry could it be used in and so if we spend more of that time exploring those Avenue and use the AI as a co-pilot to amplify uh your thought saying well this invention could be used in let's say in the medical industry in the robotic industry in the uh in rockets and things like that uh so I think that that you know it it it's it's a way of increasing um your value to the client it's not meant to cut your bill I don't see that it's it's the same argu as though when the spreadsheet came out did it did did it reduce the accountants uh fee we see that they they thrive on that because now they build on top of that and add value in the end the value to the client is what's important thank you for that Insight pal um our next question is is the information in the generative AI tool like power patents database even if it's confidential is it discoverable uh you know we we we give you a button where you can delete the file at the end because obviously um the the the the computer has to have some inkling of what your invention is in order for it to work on it so there is a as you saw at the end when I exported the word document it asks you whether or not you you want to delete the file you always have the option to come in and remove the file and it'll be gone awesome um our next question is how a adaptable do you feel these AI tools are for small and midsize firms versus very large legal departments uh it I think it's very adaptable um you know to be honest it's it's scale it's scalable in all in in in various uses uh we've seen it used in inside of companies in a small um uh a startup with a single lawyer where they use that as an invention capture tool where the inventors provide the information the lawyers would take that and very quickly spin it into a a um uh a non-provisional type of application but they file it as a provisional and then at the end of the one year they send it out to the outside Council to say hey this thing is already kind of in you know 60 70% of the shape and we want to Discount you know we want you to uh uh to give us um you we'll give you more work but basically you know give us some some uh some benefit for that um uh the the document The Authority in a in a non-provisional format um in the big firms the advantage is now you can look at other similar patent applications done by the firm uh and then it can borrow language from there so um there are uh you know there are advantages to using templates from you know done by other lawyers that you can then bring into your case and then write on top of that so in many cases where let's say you got a continuation or a continuation in part patent application you can pull that application and then add your uh enhancement on top of that um but you know I think fundamentally it works well for for you know it's scalable I.E awesome thank you um our next question is can AI be leveraged to predict patent approval probab probabilities based on historical data if so how have you found if they're reliable um the probability of success um I you know personally I don't um I guess I haven't looked at that angle the um but I think um I haven't applied you know I haven't seen AI dealing with that but from my personal experience we know that in continuation cases we work with a particular examiner and they're very predictable you know they have a particular angle that they're looking for and you can tweak your claims uh toward that examiner's preference uh so I think that's something that it's still uh very much a a human thing that that the machine cannot predict yet you know that examiner his his or her behavior and so you can uh you can add a minor tweak to that so as an example uh earlier in this week we had a an office action and uh you know the software generated a 50-page response which we sent to the examiner as a locked PDF meaning that the examiner cannot take that and put it into the file history so that's a that's a password protected PDF he can view it but he cannot put it into the into the U into the file history so uh but when we when we when we review when we had an interview with the Examiner uh you can hear that the examiner is saying well yeah but but I can see your argument but your claim if you were to to to modify it slightly to to do this it would definitely overcome my my art and so of course you know that's something a machine won't be able to pick up so uh we plug in those two words and uh and submitted the the uh the response and deleted all of the 50 pages of argument because now we've show The Examiner that look we can we can certainly uh provide a very detailed in-depth argument as to non-obviousness but by doing that it's it's going to uh put a lot of history in the file which the litigators will um you know um will could use that to their advantage and so what we do is we send them a PDF that's that's not that's password protected so that it won't be entered into the file and then we discuss with the examiner and then we can then tweak it to what we think is the examiner's easiest path to allowance if that makes sense yeah thank you for that that additional Insight we also have a couple questions about power patent pricing do you know where someone could go to find that additional information or where you can direct them uh yes uh you just go to Power pat.com uh there's a page but I uh there you know the price is $4.99 per month and so which I think um uh is is uh is uh fairly um yeah uh it's uh the price is pretty reasonable for if you do just you know an office a an application that that price alone is is um well worth it awesome thanks for that um and then we have another question here um Can generative AI handle the complexity and specificity required as patents can be very technical have you found that these tools do a good job of addressing that yes uh and I I find that sometime it actually ex you know it knows more than than than I know about a particular uh field um so um you know I do a lot of uh 5G and uh software patent applications the advantage of the AI is that it has the entire internet access at this path right and so if you guide it correctly if you put the proper um uh uh guard rails around it it's going to be very very good um just think of it this way if you were a a a new patent attorney and somebody threw you a topic that um that you're not familiar with uh guess what whatever you write you are in a way quote unquote hallucinating because you don't you're not familiar with it so the AI hallucination aspect comes in because the AI doesn't have enough information so it starts to make things up and I think humans do exactly that right so the way you control all of this is giving it very specific guide rail as to what it should be working on and so the way we give it a very strong guide guide rail is based on number one the claims and number two the drawings as you notice in the application each drawing has a bunch of reference numerals in there reference signs we call it uh and when you you know you you um you give the uh the label and and and the noun associated with that label you're basically giving it a guide rail so in a drawing let's say if you have 20 of these numbers in that describes the component within the drawing when you're giving it that kind of a detail specificity it's going to be very good and and it's going to focus on what needs to be done and so uh I've seen cases where um uh a new attorney's not familiar with the particular technology using this tool actually um was very efficient because the uh the AI put in a a an initial draft that was reasonable enough so that that attorney even though he was not familiar in that particular space can start from there and then add to it and and it it um it helps you know the people who don't have quite the specific technology to get started e quicker and easier because now you got a starting point um and I've heard that repeatedly because a lot of people uh you users they they say oh you know what it's hard to get started writing something and this thing now places a document right in front of you you may hate it and you can completely slash it out and rewrite it in scratch but at least you got a starting point great you know but in general I find that that the text is gener is is quite uh useful and so that's why on average we spend about 3 to four hours cleaning it up after they generate the draft and and and that saves us still substantial amount of time that's great yeah kind of building off what you were talking about with Drafting and editing once you're done with the draft the initial draft that it gives you this person asked how can I effectively audit and validate the accuracy of what it's generated with regard to patent claims or descriptions can you talk a little bit about your process with that um so you're talking about the claim uh in I guess in the example that that we that I provided the the the lawyers generated the claim so most lawyers prefer to control it by generating the claim so the claim is the imput so uh now the validation aspect is there is a search button and we don't call it a sear a prior art search because just I'm you know which is kind of leery of of saying well this is a prior art search it has you know connotations with that so we just say it's it's a a similarity search so but that search does go into the patent database and bring up similar references that you can take a look at and then you can you know if you think it's it's it's a it's indeed a prior art then you know you need to submit that in a in in an IDs form but then you can navigate your claims to uh account for that knowing that that that prior that you encounter now you know in in corporations most corporations don't they prefer not to do the search for various reasons right so um so you can disable that search feature or don't use it uh so that's one way is uh is you can fine-tune the claim based on the search uh as far as the uh the support in the um the the description support for the claim uh we do have an entire set of diagnostic that indicates whether or not your claim text is supported in the description so if you see the um and and this this this is a real-time feature so you'll see it appearing in the claim it it'll start colorcoded or say you look at it and you say okay this phrase doesn't occur anywhere in the description you can then copy that phrase and then go into the description and then insert uh and you can even ask the AI to create a text description for the the phrase that's that that it highlighted as not you know being present in the CL so it's a very easy way to fix the um the the claim support the 112 claim support features uh we also have the whole diagnostic as you seen as a PDF so I think um those features are going to help you in terms of crafting the um um uh you know a 112 supportive application awesome well thank you so much B for that

        "transcript": "Okay. So and finally I promised to share my best tips and tricks for how to draft patent applications for AI inventions. So the first tip is certainly make it sound as technical as possible and by that I don't mean try to disguise something non-technical as technical that really isn't my point back in the days people tried to kind of trick patent examiners by putting non-technical stuff into a pseudo-technical wording talking about modules, components, things like that. That no longer works. Instead you should always try to focus on the real technical advantages of the invention and figure out what are really the technical benefits of the innovation and highlight these throughout the patent application as prominently as possible with as many examples and meat to the bone as possible. And keep in mind that in terms of AI beneficial mathematical properties per se do not help. My second tip is even if the invention is in core AI, meaning it is independent of any particular use case, you should include as many technical application scenarios and use cases as possible. The more the better because your patent attorney will will need them probably based on the current standard as fallback positions. At some point in time you might have the choice between getting your application refused or narrowing it down, narrowing down the scope of the claims to certain technical applications of the inventive AI, which might be better than nothing. You can decide when it comes to that but you have to have the technical use cases in the application as filed. So better yet you should not only list any and all conceivable technical applications of the AI, but ideally you would also include higher abstraction layers on top, meaning you define common umbrella terms that summarize common technical characteristics of certain specific use cases, so that we have a controled abstraction hierarchy we can walk down during the examination process. The second dimension is of course the technical implementation details. So here my tip is include as many details as possible about the real technical implementation or possible technical implementation variations and again explain why they are technically beneficial.",

        "transcript": "all right welcome to the Deep dive you know how it is you want to get to the heart of things fast right cut through the noise exactly cut through that noise and really understand what's going on uh and today we're taking a deep dive into something well pretty fascinating actually you flagged a seminar for us all about using AI to draft patents yeah this is a Hot Topic oh absolutely so we've gone through all the materials from this seminar really tried to wrap our heads around it and we're going to break down the most important insights for you today so by the end of this deep dive you'll not only know what this seminar was about but also see the potential and hopefully have a few aha moments along the way absolutely and you know the materials you shared it was really a very comprehensive overview of this seminar and it was led by uh someone named Bastion best he's a patent attorney but also a computer scientist so really interesting background yeah that combination is uh pretty rare I'd say definitely and what I found interesting is that this seminar was so focused on the Practical side of things it's not just Theory it's about actually using AI in the real world to create patents and I think that's what makes it so relevant for anyone who works with intellectual property so no fluff just really getting into the nuts and bolts yeah practical stuff and looking at the materials it seems like this Bastian best guy he really structured the seminar in a very methodical way didn't he it wasn't just random AI demos thrown together no no definitely not it followed the actual process of drafting a patent application like step by step so they started with the very Basics right understanding The Invention itself you have to know what you're dealing with before you can even start thinking about patents of course the foundation exactly and then they went on to uh creating the claims and you know claims are like the heart of a patent they Define what's actually being protected yeah that's where the legal boundaries are set right exactly and after that they covered well pretty much everything else you need to know to create a full patent specification so things like the background information about the invention summarizing what it does describing it in detail and even considerations for including drawings so the whole package yeah and then of course a good chunk of the seminar was dedicated to the AI part itself different tools and techniques and how to actually use them effectively sounds like a very logical progression You Come Away with a complete picture yep a very structured approach and it wasn't just about grasping the high level Concepts right it was about actually learning practical skills yes definitely they had two main learning goals uh first they wanted to give the attendees most of whom were patent professionals a solid foundation and AI make them AI literate I guess you could say so understanding what AI can and cannot do in the context of patent work exactly and being able to you know critically evaluate AI tools and uh also understanding the Security Site of things which is a huge deal in the legal field absolutely and the second goal was to give them actual you know Hands-On skills for using these AI Tools in their everyday work so they could go back to their offices and actually Implement what they learned exactly and tailored to their specific needs and security requirements I mean everyone's situation is different right you have to adapt these tools to your own work flow absolutely and you know what I found interesting they started the seminar with a survey oh yeah what did that reveal about who's actually interested in this whole Ai and patents thing it was really interesting actually uh the attendees came from a real mix of backgrounds you had Private Practice lawyers from patent law firms in-house patent attorneys working for companies and even people from research institutions so a good cross-section of the IP world yeah and they asked them about their uh previous experience with chat GPT that's a good Benchmark right most people have at least heard of it exactly and also whether they were already using any AI Tools in their patent work what did the responses show well it was quite a spectrum actually you had some people who were already heavy AI users integrating it into their daily tasks early adopters yeah then you had some who were just starting to experiment with it you know dipping their toes in the water testing the waters exactly and then a few who were completely new to it all but the interesting thing was everyone even those who were new to AI had at least heard of chat GPT so there's definitely a general awareness of these conversational AI tools so it's permeating the field even if people aren't actively using it yet absolutely and a good majority were already using AI in their patent work which shows that this isn't just some future Trend it's happening now it's the present yeah and this really shows how relevant this seminar is it doesn't matter if you're a seasoned AI Pro or just starting out there's something for everyone so a diverse crowd all curious about what AI can bring to the table all right let's get into some specifics one of the things they explored was using AI to create patent claim CLS yeah that's big one and they actually started with a pretty naive approach using a general AI model what happened there so they took an invention disclosure which is basically a detailed description of the invention and they just fed it straight into a general AI like chat GPT and they asked it to draft a patent application bold move right and the AI did actually produce something that looked like a patent it had all the sections the title the background the description even the claims so it could mimic the format yeah but the problem was it wasn't something you could just use straight away it needed a lot of revision human input you know so not quite the Magic Bullet some people might imagine exactly and the key takeaway here was that while these General AIS can produce text that looks like a patent they don't really understand the deeper principles of patent law right like how to write claims that are both broad enough to protect the invention but also specific enough to hold up in court exactly what's called claim construction and they also don't understand the specific requirements of different patent offices around the world so the new is missing yeah and that's where specialized patent drafting tools come in right so the seminar moved on to these specialized tools what's the advantage of using those compared to just a general AI well these specialized tools are built specifically for patent drafting they're not just general chat Bots that can do a bit of everything makes sense and one important distinction they talked about was uh the deployment model so basically whether the tool is cloud-based or local okay so with cloud-based your data is processed on someone else's servers right yeah and that could be convenient you know easy to access potentially more powerful but then you have to think about data security where is your client's confidential information going it's a valid concern especially in the legal World definitely and then you have local AI tools where everything happens on your own computer so more control over your data exactly and the seminar actually mentioned a couple of specific examples of these specialized patent drafting tools like patent maker and Rowan patents giving people concrete options to explore exactly and they also did a demo of a research tool that's specifically focused on Pat drafting what did that demonstrate so this tool it takes a set of patent claims and it also takes a prior patent document basically an existing invention that's relevant to the new one to see what's already out there yeah and it uses all that to generate a description of the new invention oh that's interesting so it's not just spitting out text it's actually trying to connect the dots between the new invention and what already exists right and what's also cool is that it can do some basic checks on the claims to see if they make sense and then it generates this pretty detailed description that actually relates the claims to the technology in the prior patent sounds like it's bringing more of that patent specific knowledge to the table yeah it's getting more sophisticated the seminar also explored a more Hands-On approach using AI models directly can you walk us through that so this part was all about interacting with the AI actually giving it instructions and they used a local AI model for this which as we said is great for data security keeps everything on your own machine exactly and they focused on Crafting these uh Specific Instructions called prompts so it's like telling the AI what you want it to do right yeah but you have to be very specific and they even started with a priming prompt which is basically setting the stage for the AI like telling it okay you're an experienced patent attorney who specializes in European patent applications so you're giving it a Persona to work with exactly and the idea is that by doing that you're going to get more focused and relevant responses from the AI more in line with the kind of expertise you need right and one of the first things they tried was to just give the AI the whole invention Disclosure document and ask to generate a summary so like a highlevel overview yeah and what happened was the AI produced information that wasn't even in the original document they called it a hallucination a hallucination yeah basically the AI just made stuff up oh wow so it's not as simple as just feeding it information and trusting everything it spits out definitely not you always have to double check verify everything AI is RO of predicting the next word in a sequence but it doesn't actually understand facts or truth a critical reminder it's a tool not a replacement for human judgment absolutely and they did have more success when they gave the AI more specific tasks okay like what so one thing they did was they asked the AI to draft a broad patent claim for a very specific technical concept and in that case the AI did a much better job because it had a clearer Target so the more precise your instructions the better the output right and they also looked at how AI can help with refining the language in claims like finding broader or narrower terms yeah so let's say you have a specific term in your claim right you can ask the AI to generate a high hierarchy of related terms like starting with very broad terms then going to more specific ones an example would be helpful sure so imagine your claim uses the term neural network you could ask the AI to suggest broader terms that Encompass that like machine learning model and then you could also ask it to suggest more specific types of neural networks like recurrent neural network or convolutional neural network so it's like using the AI to expand your vocabulary and see your invention from different angles exactly and one of the attendees actually said this was really helpful for them to think outside their usual terminology and what about phrasing the claims themselves can AI help with that yeah they showed how you can ask the AI to generate different ways of phrasing the same claim like you could ask for a functional claim which focuses on what the invention does right the outcome exactly then you could ask for a structural claim which describes what the invention is made of the components yeah and then a method claim which outlines the steps involved in the invention so you get a complete picture of how to protect your invention from different legal angles right and another attendee mentioned that this helped them identify limitations in their claims that they hadn't thought of before really interesting how AI can bring those New Perspectives and finally they talked about using AI to simulate a patent examiner scrutiny yeah that was a cool part the idea is to use the AI to anticipate potential objections that a patent examiner might raise so it's like a practice run before you actually submit your application exactly and they showed how you can prompt the AI to act as say a European patent office examiner and you can ask ask it to point out any potential issues with the clarity of your claims and then you can refine your claims based on that feedback exactly so you're more prepared when you actually submit your application makes a lot of sense so we've covered the claims which are obviously cwal but what about the other parts of a patent application like the background the summary and the detailed description yeah they cover that too so for the background section they emphasize the importance of using very detailed prompts like telling the AI to include things like the field of invention the problems with exis technology and the objective of the invention so setting the stage for your invention right and they showed a good example using Google Gemini where the AI actually produced a very concise and informative background section based on those instructions impressive they also talked about a more interactive approach where the AI actually has a conversation with you to gather the information for the background so more collaborative yeah and for the summary section they focus on using these one-hot instruction prompts basically you give the AI one detailed instruction and it generates the whole summary and what would that instruction typically include well you would tell the AI to focus on the key aspects of your claims Define any important terms and explain the advantages of your invention so it's like a condensed version of your whole patent highlighting the most important points exactly and they also showed how you can use AI to brainstorm the technical effects of your invention like what are the specific outcomes or benefits that result from your invention that could be really helpful for fleshing out the details yeah and one of the attendees said that this helped them articulate the benefits of their invention much more clearly now what about defining technical terms that can be tricky in patent applications yeah and they mentioned a tool called perplexity AI which is really good for that it gives you definitions of terms but it also provides citations for the sources so you can see where the definition is coming from exactly which is really important for accuracy and making sure you're using the correct terminology now patent drawings are a visual element often very detailed and precise what role did AI play in that part of the seminar well they did talk about using AI to generate patent drawings but they were pretty honest about the limitations the current AI image generation models they're not quite there yet they can produce some creative stuff but it's often not technically accurate or suitable for patent filings so not replacing human illustrators just yet no but they did highlight a more practical use of AI for drawings they showed how you can use chat GPT to generate descriptions of existing figures so you give the AI a diagram and it can produce a detailed textual explanation of everything in the diagram so it's like automating the process of writing figure descriptions exactly which can save a lot of time now one of the most important things especially when you're dealing with confidential information is security oh absolutely and the seminar really addressed that head-on they talked about the advantages of using local AI tools like gp4 all because all your data stays on your own device no risk of it leaking out to the cloud right and then they compared the Privacy policies of some of the big cloud-based platforms like Google Gemini and chat GPT what were the key differences there well one key difference was how they use or don't use user data for training their AI models right because that's a big concern for a lot of people definitely and they pointed out that Google's workspace plan it explicitly says that your data is not used for training and that no humans are reviewing it so that offers a pretty strong Assurance of privacy sounds reassuring yeah and chat GPT they do allow you to opt out of having your data used for training but their policies suggests that human review might still happen in some cases so there's a bit more ambig it there yeah and the seminar really emphasized the importance of carefully reviewing the Privacy policies of any AI tool you're considering using especially for confidential work that's crucial advice and you know I actually prefer to use offline Solutions when I'm dealing with client data just to be on the safe side yeah that's a good approach so looking back at the whole seminar what's the big takeaway about ai's role in patent drafting right now I think the main message was that AI is a really powerful assistant for patent drafting but it's not a replacement for human expertise a tool not a takeover exactly and it can help with all sorts of things from brainstorming ideas and refining claims to generating parts of the patent application so potentially making the whole process more efficient yeah and maybe even improving the quality of patent applications but it's still up to the human patent professional to be in control absolutely you have to understand the technology you have to know how to craft effective prompts and you have to critically evaluate the ai's output no short cuts to becoming a good patent attorney definitely not but AI can definitely be a valuable tool in Your Arsenal well this deep dive has given us a really good overview of what the seminar covered and you know if anyone out there is feeling intrigued wanting to delve even deeper into this whole Ai and patent world there's good news oh yeah what's that Bastion best the guy who led the seminar he actually runs these sessions regularly oh wow so people can actually go and learn from him directly exactly if you're looking for that hands-on experience you can find all the information about upcoming dates and gets on his website www.p power claim. fantastic so if you're really serious about integrating AI into your patent work that's the place to go absolutely and as you think about everything we've discussed today here's a final thought to leave you with how could you see yourself using these AI tools not just to save time but also to gain new insights and maybe even strengthen your whole approach to intellectual property it's a really fascinating area to explore thanks for joining us for this deep dive my pleasure",

        "transcript": "hey it's me Bastian and today we're going to talk about essential AI tools to boost your patent attorney practice in 2024 so um I promise to share the exact AI tools I'm using currently myself in my day-to-day patent attorney work and that's what we're going to do in this session today um so basically there are from my point of view um three types of tasks where I'm exploring generative AI support these days and the three tasks are on the one hand patent drafting obviously secondly we have document analyses that's what we're also going to look into on uh number three we have client Communications um not sure if we have time for all three in this 30 minute session but let's see um how far we can get as always I'm recording these uh sessions live on LinkedIn so please put your comments and questions into the chat box and I'll try to answer them as we go and here's a question for you what's your favorite AI tool at the moment doesn't have to um be for patent drafting um let's talk about patent work in general so what are you doing in the patent industry and what's your favorite AI tool to help you at the moment what are you exploring um just drop it in the comments so we can all learn from each other okay so with that being said that um let's just um start with um topic number one patent drafting obviously so you may have noticed uh maybe that AI assisted patent drafting is kind of my passion project these days um and there has been I would say some kind of evolution on my own AI patent drafting Journey um so um basically it all began when chat GPT came out right in November 202 2 I guess it was um I started looking into AI chatbots uh besides chat GPT of course local models I've posted content about those local um AI models at that time uh I have to say they pretty much sucked at patent drafting very much so um uh the the output was just full of hallucinations full of weird sentences um they didn't write the way I would draft a patent application so I thought well jgpt is nice for you know private stuff but for patent drafting it's basically useless that was my my first beginning my first baby steps in this um um space so to say um then I I was looking further um into patent drafting software right so dedicated software tools to to um um streamline the patent drafting uh uh process and um I was surprised that there were these you know onshot application generators popping up left and right basically every week uh I got like multiple uh DMS and posts on LinkedIn advertising a new patent drafting um um generator I call them oneshot application generators because the the idea is basically you put a set of claims in and you get a draft out a full dra draft um that's also for me the biggest problem I have with those tools I don't use them productively myself um because at that time when I was trying out these these one shot um application generators they basically had you know no way to guide the AI and no way to customize the output so you just uh had to throw your your claim set in and you would get uh a full draft out of it um which was yeah structured the way the the tool manufacturer thought a good patent application should look like but it was never quite the way I would draft it myself um so I never used those those oneshot patent application generators um myself in my my practice um nevertheless there is uh a place for those of course um so if you want to know more about those um patent drafting robots um consider um joining one of Martin schweiger's workshops I'm sure pretty sure you will know Martin schwier um I put a link to his workshops into the show notes after this I kind of turned back to AI chat Bots to see whether there was uh some development going on you know um I also worked on my prompting skills um so I try to learn how to provide better input to the AI and uhhuh suddenly uh the results were quite of astonishingly good uh I have to say so I mean it goes without saying uh should basically be a no-brainer right providing better input improves the output uh by orders of magnitude really so um yeah it was really surprising to me on the one how the the the local models got better during let's say a time frame of six to to 10 months maybe at that time but also Al how the results really really improved by orders of magnitude um when you just feed them with proper inputs with proper prompts um so what I did is just recently um I don't know if you've seen it I I kind of compressed all I know about prompt engineering uh into a video course which you can also find on my website power power claim. um I'll also put a link into the show notes if you're interested in that um at that point I kind of had a realization when I was using the the the chatbots more and more during my patent drafting work and the realization was basically that um from my point of view AI chatbots are quite great for you know writing text portions of a draft but um there are at least three severe limitations where I think that they really fall short one limitation is um that it's uh you know you have when you're using uh an an offline um AI model or if you're even using jgpt if you want uh to draft your patent um you always have this back and forth between you know the chat interface on the one hand and your word or your text processing uh uh program where you are writing your your patent application document right you always have to switch between the two there is no real integration um so that's one shortcoming of um AI chatbots for patent drafting I would say um the other really severe uh um shortcoming for me was that there is basically no reasonable or no no usable um um way to create the drawings of a patent I've never managed to use uh an AI model an an llm a chatbot uh uh to in such a way that it creates uh you know simple black and white uh line drawings which would be um suitable for a patent and also and that's the third limitation um as far as I know at least I mean there is not really a way to ensure you know consistency when you move between parts of the application see when you're drafting a patent application um I guess if you do it like I do uh uh to any degree it's not really a waterfall process where you finish one part and then you go on to the next but you kind of you know iterate between different parts you you write the claims first probably like I do uh yes uh then you start um drafting the the the figures and um the specification but then I mean you you go back and forth between all the parts and change something here and there and so um and you have to ensure that uh everything stays consistent yourself uh basically when you are using um AI um um chat Bots you know like chat GPT or local uh llms um so those were basically my realizations using chatbots for patent drafting more and more hey it's great for producing portions of the text of my application but um it's not really a replacement for it does not fundamentally you know streamline the whole uh uh working process of of drafting a patent application that's then when I encountered yet another class of of patent drafting software which I call Integrated drafting environments these are these tools are more like um I don't know if you have a programming uh background maybe to some degree you might might know those um integrated development environments idees like I don't know eclipse or or py Charm uh basically your cockpit where you are developing your code where you are writing your software code and those come with all uh sorts of uh you know helpful assistance and helpful plugins and things Little Helpers like syntax highlighting autocomplete compiler integration Version Control things like that and um such tools also exist for the patent drafting profession I didn't know that beforehand but uh then I encountered one of those tools and and uh so that's kind of my history you know where uh the path I did from um yeah uh learning about the existence of chat gbt in uh end of 2022 up to um today where and that's the next point I want to talk about uh my current tool chain uh comes into play So currently I'm using a mix of those tools I just described right um currently what I'm using when I'm really drafting a patent is um first of all all I do in my work for clients is completely offline so I don't use um Cloud software like chat GPT or anything else with one little exception I'm going to tell you in a in a second but for the real Drafting and for the real you know processing of the um details of the invention that's underlying the patent application to be drafted um I only use um fully local offline tools that run on my my local computer uh what I do use is a chat GPT for all with a local model um these days it's Lama 3.2 and together with uh Rowan patn that's uh this integrated drafting environment I was talking about um I don't think we have time for a demo today because I want to keep these sessions here um below 30 minutes but um there's some other videos out there where I've talked about uh this tool combination right a local llm in my case is it's run by Chet GPD for all and it's Lama 3.2 and an integrated patent drafting environment like row and patents in my um in my situation why this combination um you might ask um because um even why gbd for all anyway when row patents has its own AI chatbot well for me that's uh um um one little downside of row and patterns yes they do have um local llm support they have their own small uh local large small language model uh integrated in in the r patterns but it's yeah kind of integrated in a way that I don't really find it too much useful um what I prefer is to have and that's maybe a takeaway also for you for your work um what I tend to do these days and that was also a realization I had uh recently I've uh only tried this this style of drafting out um like three times now I guess um whenever I start a new patent application whenever I start a new project right I open up a Rowan patents project right a new file where that's basically my cockpit okay I'm going to show you uh real quick so let me get to the screen sharing and let me fire up my Rowan pattern so um real quick just so I'm going to start a new application um I'm going to select my template file my usual template file and so I have you know the whole skeleton of the application with some um boilerplate uh language already filled in which I always use that's my cockpit that's the integrated drafting environment where I really produ use where I put in all the text right and uh at the end I can export this into a Word document which is then the full application and also a PDF comes out with the drawings row patn also has a nice drawing um editor uh too much for for this video but what I'm also doing whenever I start a new patent application is I start up um GPD for all and I start a new chat I name the chat with the you know uh file reference of my new uh patent application and I keep this chat for as long as I'm drafting this application from start to finish and uh what I do is I really have a conversation an ongoing continuous conversation with the AI when I'm drafting the whole application from beginning to end um what I also do is GPD for all has this ability to um include uh local documents so it can read local docu documents and what I do is of course I dump in the invention description I got right the IDF The Invention disclosure form I added to to the chat here so um Lama 3.2 can read it and so I can have a chat with my AI assistant about the invention then I draft my claims uh then I ask uh the llm about the claims and maybe ask it to to challenge the claims things like that to to suggest um you know different wording things like that once I have the claims finished I take them and copy them into Rowan and then the work basically iterates between Rowan patterns on the one hand and uh the chat on the other hand but the nice thing about having one chat throughout the whole process of drafting one patent application is that you always have the chat the model always have this his has this history in mind right of what you have been talking about concerning this invention and it always carries with it this memory of uh uh what you were discussing beforehand about this specific invention so it has a lot more context um I also I'm I'm on my way to um compile this exact tool set up but first and foremost especially this workflow I'm doing let's say the method the process how I do uh a patent drafting project I'm going to compile this also in an online course this will be kind of my masterpiece I guess so it will still take some time um so I hope this is uh will be out there in fall uh later this year hopefully I will I'm really proud of that course because it will really show my my my whole method my whole process um so yeah let's see how that plays out um I'm going to hurry up if you want to um stay in the loop and uh get informed uh when that new course is um online then you might want to go to Power claim. my website and there's at the bottom there's a sign up form where you can put yourself onto my email list so you will be the first to know when the new course will be online um okay so summing up this tool setup so the roles of these two TOS uh basically are in my setup on the one hand GPD for all with the local model Lama 3.2 these days the role of that tool is basically my assistant my co-pilot right I have a conversation with it about the invention I'm brainstorming you know technical effects patentability arguments um I I have it review my claims I have it challenge my claims I have it write parts of the description I've done videos about that um too and on the other hand I have row and patents my integrated integrated patent drafting environment here I create the drawings I autogenerate reference signs I keep them consistent across the description Rowan does that really nicely I also create terms and manage their definitions maybe let me show you uh real quick so that's a nice feature of row and patterns is uh so when you write your claims that's how I do it most of the time uh when I'm writing my claims um I go through the claims and select you know the key terms which I need to Define in my patent application and I turn them into uh it's called terms in in row and patterns and those are then kind of objects which can be reused in all sorts of places uh throughout um the the patent application so let's say uh let's say we are writing a patn application about Ai and machine learning so one key term would of course must be uh let's say large language model right I would create that term and then it uh creates this little box here uh where I can insert a definition of that term what I do is um I use perplexity AI for coming up with definitions of technical terms and that's the one um exception I was mentioning in the beginning that's the one online tool I'm using when I'm drafting patterns because I only use it for standard technical terms right not for invention features but only for standard technical terms so in this case I would say something like Define large language model uh for a patent patent App application right and it then comes up with yeah a nice um definition and I would then put that into you know row and pattern um to have this term defined then in my patent application as I said this can then this becomes an object in R patents and you can insert it in various places keep it consistent things like that so that's that's pretty nice uh okay so that's basically the role of row and patterns and together row and patterns together with a local llm like um GPT for all I think that's a powerful uh combination as I said I'm currently customizing the whole tool chain to my needs and I'm I'm also refining my workflow um there will be uh this this um Masterpiece video course of mine where I really show the exact tool chain my process when drafting a patent application uh uh from end to end so from The Invention description as input up to the ready to file patent application again get on the mailing list uh for uh updates on power claim. AO um okay so that was basically um the first part um the longest part um today about uh patent drafting the second topic I want to talk about was document analysis because when I talk about patent drafting I always talk about I always start from the from the perfect invention description so to say but um thinking also about in-house uh uh patent professionals maybe I mean your one of your um tasks is of course to let's say encourage the inventors right to come up with very good invention descriptions um invention descriptions before you passed them on to the external um patent attorneys so I was wondering well how can AI maybe also help um you know expand and enhance invention descriptions and I also it's it's not only useful for in-house patent people but also for external uh um patent attorneys like me because I mean when I get a new um instruction to draft a patent application and when the client sends me the invention description um I'm starting from zero right I have to read it and I have to understand the invention and I was wondering how can AI help here so this is kind of more exploratory uh in my uh um state of mind right now because I just recently started thinking about uh this use case um what I found very interesting recently was a tool called um notebook LM this is actually I've talked about this in another um episode where we were um listening to an AI generated podcast because that's what this tool can do um it's a experimental tool from Google called notebook LM and um it lets you create a project you can dump in um documents and then you can also have a chat with the document you can have summaries of the document things like that so maybe that's an interesting tool um of course the question is you have to answer that yourself whether you want to use this for um um processing invention descriptions I don't um I don't use an online tool like this for um working with confidential information but on the other hand um Google notebook LM is quite interesting because if we look into the privacy policy I have it here it says that as long as you have the um you know I think it's called Google workspace account the paid account which I do it says that as a Google workspace user your uploads queries and the models responses in Notebook LM will not be reviewed by human review and will not be used to train AI model so sounds pretty pretty uh uh solid I would say in terms of confidentiality nevertheless I don't use it uh productively nevertheless I wanted to show you this tool quickly so what you can do is you can just uh upload a document in that use case you would upload the invention disclosure right I don't have one here and I wouldn't show it if I had so what uh as an example we can just do is upload just let's say a scientific paper um I have here the latest paper uh from an Austrian University about xlsm which is sets out to be kind of the the open AI killer right uh sets out to be an artificial neuron Network structure which is supposed to be superior than the Transformer architecture which is the basis for all other llms we know like Google Gemini and and chbt and it's also a valid use case I guess because in my experience when I'm working with universities um they often send me the paper draft as the invention disclosure so this is a good starting point maybe so let's just as an example uh dump this paper um into no that didn't didn't work let's see I think I have to say create ah here okay now I can dump the paper here into the notebook and once Google AI Gemini has gone through the paper and has analyzed it it even gives me a uh summary um right from the outset it says this research paper explores the development and evaluation of a new type of recurrent neural network called X lsdm designed to overcome limitations of traditional lsdm and so on it introduces exponential gating and novel memory structures so I do know that paper so I know that this summary is pretty accurate it Gemini has picked up pretty nicely on uh let's say the fundamental aspects um here it also gives you suggested questions or you could just now start exploring the invention right you could say something like um how is it better than the Transformer architecture and you can just have a conversation with um with uh the AI model about uh whatever document you have put in there and here we have the answer so it says um several advantages of this architecture over the Transformer um linear computational and memory complexity that's yeah that's really the main difference I would say that's interesting Gemini really picked up on that nicely unlike Transformers xlsm exhibit linear computational and constant memory complexity whereas Transformers are I think quadratic um so pretty nicely I could also think about doing something like give me a list of key terms that make up the invention maybe as a first you know starting point to dig deeper into into the invention description why not uh let the thei give me a list of the key terms so that I can focus on those okay it's about X lsdm yes exponential gating is an important feature normalization and stabilization modified memory structures pretty nicely I have to say so this could really be a tool like this could really be a nice way you know to dive into a new invention more quickly than you could if you just had you know the document and you would have to read it um um on your own all right so um of course as I said notebook LM is an a cloud-based tool I don't use it productively myself for for confidential information so an offline alternative again would be um GPD for all right you could also do basically the same thing here it's in a different UI and some features are different of course but the idea is the same right you have these local docs in GPT for all so uh you could add um let's call this X lstm and let's just add um this document at the paper here and now it gets indexed by the AI so the Mi uh so the AI model is trying to to read through the document and index it and once that is done um you can also chat with with the document in uh GPT for all basically as you would uh do in the in the notebook I just uh showed you okay we're running out of time so no time for this demo also um I think we don't have time for the third topic I was planning client Communications maybe that's up to um uh next time um so in that sense yeah let's call it a day I would say I hope you found this helpful um if you did check out my website power claim. that's the place where I host my online courses and my live webinars on the topic of generative AI for patent attorneys so again it's power claim. I'll put the link into the show notes and in that sense thanks for tuning in and see you in the next one bye-bye",
